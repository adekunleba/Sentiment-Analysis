 'controversial' scenes that manage not to be controversial 
 'easy money' ( 1983 ) and 'back to school' ( 1986 ) . 'back to school' is probably the funniest and most likable of these films but dangerfield ( who is 75 ) has lost his way pretty much with 'meet wally sparks' . rodney portrays an unorthodox tabloid talk show host who becomes mixed up in one wild situation with a southern governor and his family who are extremely conservative . dangerfield's son becomes romantically involved with the governor's daughter and a television executive's assistant who's trying to have rodney fired is in tow and gets exactly what he deserves . throw in a political sex scandal and a head butting feud with dangerfield's television boss ( burt reynolds ) and you have the makings for a trivial and desperate comedy of enormously bad proportions . someone should have told dangerfield ( who co-wrote the picture ) that less is sometimes more and that good comedy doesn't necessarily include throwing in everything but the kitchen sink in order to make people laugh and the film degrades not only itself but the audience . furthermore the film is bogged down with dangerfield's one liners that are growing tiresome . it's slapstick humour is both juvenile and self defeating . given the limited release this film had 
 'fierce creatures' is a disaster not so much because of what it's about but because it tries to capture the same level of humour as 'a fish called wanda' did . the personalities of the characters in this movie are similar in nature to 'wanda' and some of the scenes are downright copycats of that film . the jokes and the physical gags are surprisingly flat and the movie is abruptly immature at the wrong moments and the word that comes to mind to sum it all up is 'phony' . even more preposterous is the fact that it took two men to direct this farcical mess ( robert young and fred schepisi ) and john cleese is aided in the screenplay by iain johnstone . producer michael shamberg should have recognized that this film wouldn't work and even if you've never seen 'a fish called wanda' you still will recognize the flaws that make this production superficial and self-serving . 
 'leaving las vegas' and many other stronger films were made about the same issues . so what's the point ? in other words '28 days' doesn't contribute to the moviemaking business on any level . if you're caught in a snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from the sky and you're standing in front of the movie theatre

 'the godfather' or 'star wars' they will certainly fail . a remake of the 1968 film 'the thomas crown affair' directed by norman jewison probably sounded like a good idea at the time but who knew things could go so wrong . the original starred steve mcqueen and faye dunaway and this remake is with pierce brosnan and rene russo . brosnan is a corporate big shot named thomas crown in new york city who has a passion for antique paintings . he also likes to steal them . not for the cash but for the sheer pleasure of having them hang in his home . his latest fancy is a painting worth one hundred million dollars . after scooping it up

 a bland performance by cage and a clandestine feeling of being trapped --- already experienced by 1995's 'seven' . another problem with this film is its editing . it's too static at times and too quick at other times and comes across as very sloppy and uneven . some of the situations and dialogue are also absurd . we see that cage has a wife ( catherine keener ) and baby daughter and his wife is constantly showing her faithful traits towards her husband and supports him in his career and later in the film

" all clamoring around the "" serious social problem "" of gun control . while there's no denying that the usa has over fifty million gun owners and it's a subject worthy of address and debate "
 all failing to build even a semblance of suspense . imagine apollo 13 if it were made really badly -- bad filmmaking coupled with an ending that you can't change ( though donaldson actually tries to trick us at many points by interspersing stock footage of nuclear explosions into the movie

" all i could really think of is how virtually the same exact story had been filmed with a great deal more thoughtfulness and maturity in 1983's "" all the right moves . "" one of the biggest problems i had with the film is how little of interest any of the characters actually were "
 all i was left with was to stare at the screen 
 all in all 
 all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script . it's fun for a while 
 all in their early 20s are given a choice : they either go to jail for the various crimes that they all have committed 
 all mocked up to look like the amazon jungle . leo ends up getting captured by a group of talking apes and is sold to a slave trader named limbo ( paul giamatti ) who in turn sells leo to a chimpanzee named ari ( helena bonham carter ) . the kind ari then helps leo and his fellow humans escape to the mountains to find leo's ship . along the way

 all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience . maybe it will work for some people . it didn't work for me . billy crystal plays sam cayman 
 all of which are jaw-droppingly absurd -- a feat that joe eszterhas ( the writer of basic instinct and showgirls ) would be impressed by . thanks to jeffrey kimball's polished 
 all of which have next to nothing to do and aren't even given multi-dimensional characters to attempt to develop . coming off of her oscar-caliber work in two of last year's best films 
 all of which isn't necessary . there are some bright spots 
 all right 
 all searching for deeper meaning . however 
 all spliced together to give a general impression of the script . unfortunately 
 all that hard work is paying off . let readers be warned in advance 
 all the blame can rest firmly on the shoulders of the film's three writers ( another bad movie with multiple writers . what is this ? ) . this script is so insipidly stupid it doesn't deserve to be analyzed 
 all the characters 
 all the characters voices were dubbed by four different people : hal warren 
" all the empty mau-mauing - even the mental separation of us into "" blacks "" and "" negroes "" ( or "
 all the good parts are in the trailers . the plot which is very confusing at times is also very ludicrous and the movie is destined to be a hit in the first weekend 
 all the malt-liquor drinking 
 all the sex -- all at his fingertips . and 
 all the talk they do about keeping commitments and upholding responsibilities only really applies to fun things

" all the while avoiding the "" other man "
" all the while he spars and forms an unlikely bond with james . "" this ain't no buddy movie "
 all the while making breakfast 
 all we get is quick glimpses into their lives 
 all we're left with here is a skeleton of a film which might've been funny 
 all with very little in the way of a point or anything funny -- and with * zero * chemistry in the entire lot . as a fan of `kids in the hall 
 all without quinn ever noticing . also added to the pointless proceedings is some would-be humorous shenanigans involving quinn's dimwitted deputy ernie attempting to engage in clandestine patrol car sex with his girlfriend donna ( karen sillas ) . with a half hour ( if even that long ) remaining

 allowing films like american pie 
 allowing for many scenes of fake hands and arms being thrown around . cheesy gore . that's another main element of watchers reborn . it has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing and only increase the film's campiness rather than its suspense . ultimately 
 allowing his foreign and physically imposing co-stars to step into the spotlight when the going gets rough . let the characters interaction sans swords and shields 
 allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity . nossiter's film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain . if signs & wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas

 although i was disappointed that they weren't a little more inventive . certainly 
 although i'll admit that the film's erotic content is somewhat less impressive than i expected . nothing about wild things is exceptionally risqu . the soft-core sex sequences are generic

 although they get a few allies who are marginally interesting ( before they get killed rather unceremoniously ) . i wish there was more to leave out 
 although they still look cheap and repetitive and downright boring . there are some attempts for the movie to have a plot between the numerous scenes of violence 
 although this makes for some ridiculous ( albeit unpredictable ) plot twists along the way . there's also an interesting subplot revolving around danny's father ( brian cox ) 
 although this time the gag falls completely flat . there's even an exact replica of the conversion scene in the church of reverend cleophus ( james brown ) . there are plenty of recurring characters too . in addition to mother stigmata and reverend cleophus

 and has come out with something that can't be taken seriously . it did fill me with respect for world war two veterans

 and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha ) . not that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving ; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond-ian opening ( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir ) 
 and have no intention to move back down south to the rural kilronan . but those intentions are about to change . you see

 and he begins following the widowed abby ( gwyneth paltrow ) 
" and he begins to fight it . the "" monster "" turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course . he turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course "
 and he brings a nice comic edge to his performance . although smith and kline develop a good rapport and work well together 
 and he brings more complexity to the role than was originally on paper . outside providence is strongly reminiscent of richard linklater's 1993 slacker generation comedy dazed and confused 
 and he brings with him an offer from the nhl . the new york rangers will come to mystery to play the locals . the mysterians see this as both good and bad . on the one hand 
 and he decided that 
 and he does a decent job of soldiering on while the film collapses around him . john lithgow gets dragged in for a wasteful little cameo as a drug-dispensing doctor 
 and he does a pretty good job here . the scenes between nick and danny are very good 
 and he does an all right job as j . d . but he isn't as funny as he has been in the past . amanda peet plays the ultimate bitch as judith 
 and he finds himself in the charge of a sick little boy . dave retires to train up-and-coming stunt stars 
 and he finds the local traditions and myths that obstruct his task to be incomprehensible . ( as may be expected from this culture clash 
 and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is ( i would quote the line i like but it would probably lose its effect ) . crystal is always entertaining 
 and he hardly establishes a menacing presence . smith brings an arrogant attitude to the role 
 and he has a few good lines here ( some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely ) ; often 
 and he has helmed a bunch of howlers . and carpenter doesn't help with his obnoxious 
 and he is a charismatic presence . i don't know if it's his judgment or the dearth of quality job offers that leads him to involve himself with bombs such as black dog . regardless 
 and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon . this is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon's parents is crawling everywhere 
 and he must speak to flowers 
 and he really can't carry a film on his zany attempt to be a thespian ( see also lost and found ) . the collection of bit parts given to such notable actors as roseanne arquette ( a 'gator ranch owner ) 
 and he seems like a nice guy on talk shows 
 and he seems to think he's in comedy 
 and he seems uncomfortable with the more comic elements of the script . even schneider's desperate attempts to breathe some humour into proceedings with a series of throw away one liners fall flat . knock offis a disappointing and muddled actioner that marks a new low in van damme's declining career . at this rate 
 and he sets about avenging his untimely death . typical of summer blockbusters 
" and he stated "" i take only the roles which interest me . "" if that's the case "
 and he tries to duplicate some of that energy here . however 
 and he wants to cause carnage with these tiny but immensely powerful super weapons . he even stoops so low to put them into children's toys . if you thought this plot outline sounded intriguing 
" and he wears white make-up for a distinct "" ghoulish "" appearance . according to the information available to me "
 and he will soon die . to be fair 
 and he would rather attempt to dazzle us with fantastic camera angles than engage us with the plot . i suppose i enjoyed some of the camera work 
 and he's framed for the murder . however 
 and he's instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion . then there's the daughter subplot 
 and he's just purely enjoyable to watch . catherine keener is completely wasted as cage's wife 
 and he's killing people because of it . so 
 and he's never around for them 
 and he's soon mating like crazy 
 and he's very familiar with chinatown . that's probably why the powers-that-be decide to team him up with a rookie named danny wallace ( mark wahlberg ) . nick and danny begin by stepping on each other's toes 
 and head back only to hit someone on the road . they then choose to dump the body in the sea 
 and head out when the sun goes down in futile attempts to get into upscale nightclubs and score with the ladies . after countless rejections ( in a movie like this 
 and heads for the hills . original sin then briefly tries to be a thriller . we see boy go whore-chasing 
 and her best friend e ( new comer bridie carter ) 
 and her complex performance provides the film with much of its emotional depth . glover is understated in a role that never really goes anywhere . newton is superb 
 and her fellow stars 
 and her funding is about to be cut . so she drags her benefactor 
 and her genteel southern hospitality makes helen feel welcome immediately -- even if her first meeting with martha takes place while helen is in the altogether 
 and her screen time turns out to be the only stuff worth watching . the rest of the film is interminable 
 and her sole purpose in the movie is to be the object of the other characters' fantasies . everyone else in the film seems to be in a competition to see who can stoop to the lowest level by the time the film ends . the parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as the movie proceeds . the father ( played by j . t . walsh ) fantasizes about the babysitter ; the mother fantasizes about her husband's best friend . none of these fantasy sequences 
 and her telling him she's not interested ( but not why ) 
 and hey 
 and him either wounding or killing them . at some points 
 and hip soundtrack 
 and his alien form more closely resembles the alien than eve's alien body ( which ironically was designed by alien designer h . r . giger ) . a large alien hive that our heros douse with a substance fired from large guns ? aliens sans flamethrowers . the visual effects were by far the best thing about species 
 and his attempts to stop the wedding . as far as plots go 
 and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this . he 
 and his character is the most bland . as luke puts it 
 and his character makes a compelling moral compass for danny . but the film ultimately fails 
 and his girlfriend has just been introduced so we couldn't care less about her . things are even worse with tyler's comrades . they die all the time without anyone really knowing just who died . everytime anyone dies 
 and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career . famke janssen 
 and his jarring screen presence thereafter 
 and his performance is stiff and tired . i hate to say it 
 and his performance suffers . the manic murphy we saw in the 80's is gone 
 and his physical humor . that's how start the revolution without me grabbed me off the comedy shelf 
" and his plans for sabotage . what ensues is a series upon series of completely unrelated conflicts . the first such scene takes place on an abandoned spaceship and what ensues could best be described as "" alien "" -lite . the story changes again when the robinsons crash land on an alien planet and must act quickly to escape it and survive . but there's never any real notion of suspense here because the script constantly wanders aimlessly . plotlines are developed "
 and his scenes are pretty funny . rob schneider is also funny as a crazy delivery man . the two twins who play julian are o . k 
 and his second-in-command 
 and his team of crack deputies 
 and his team of writer john hodge and producer andrew macdonald 
 and his wives ( jackey neyman 
 and historically it's mostly confused . if one were to judge history by this film 
 and hit 
 and hollow to the core . wild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during the first eleven weeks of 1998 . i've seen more convincing drama ( with nearly as much bare flesh ) on that pinnacle of narrative quality 
" and hope that they make it as good as the original . we need to get new ideas and stop recycling old ones just to make money at the box-office . we need to get more films like "" the blair witch project "" that could scare people to death "
 and hoped some of it would stick . fights 
 and hopefully 
 and horribly tacky bad guys 
 and housesitter . the script of father of the bride ii is based on that of father's little dividend 
 and how and why they would do it . part of the joy of those films was slowly discovering 
 and how did they pull it off ? was it 
 and how he should have gotten married does not make for a very scary chucky . and tiffany harping about mid life crisis 
 and how important it is to actually have a story . the film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted 
 and how she should have gotten married does not make for a very scary tiffany . the suspenseless bride of chucky relies mostly on jennifer tilly's cleavage to keep attention during the first half 
 and how they hid in the sand

 and humanity 
 and i actively hate it now

" and i can only hope he'll never be handed another project . "" the cell "" runs a long 105 minutes . i'd recommend it only to psychology majors who want to either argue or agree with the film's message and to aspiring directors so they can see how not to present strange visuals . i give the movie one and a half out of five stars . comments ? send to : johnbeachem@dependentfilms . netpast reviews can be found at : http : //www . epinions . com/user-elerad ? public=yes or http : //us . imdb . com/reviewsby ? john + beachem * * * * * - one of the best movies of the year . * * * * - great flick "

 and i don't blame them . they declined to screen the picture for critics 
 and i don't know where i'm at . . . well 
 and i don't reccomend you do 
 and i even remember seeing one flashback scene which went even further into its own flashback scene ! ! hullo . . . ? ! ? confused yet ? i was and i basically stopped giving a crap about anyone in the film when i realized that neither the writer or director was interested in presenting me with any kind of semblance of a story . random swordplay 
 and i found my mind wandering every once in a while . it is also very episodic 
 and i found myself laughing pretty hard .  schwimmer is also funny 
 and i give it * star . the young-uns : this film contains lots of violence and showcases it as a way of solving problems 
 and i give it one out of five stars . any past movies you want me to review ? send to : johnbeachem@dependentfilms . net for past reviews 
 and i guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close . in fact 
 and i guess that's the fourth point in my rating . anyway 
 and i hate everything they do . i also hate ryan phillippe 
 and i haven't even gotten around to the greatest piece of over-acting that i've seen in years . the man who plays kell in this movie 
 and i headed into the theatre expecting one of those movies which sacrificed plot and characterisation in favour of relentless excitement . i was half right : there's not much plot and not much characterisation 
 and i hope never to see another film from either of them . so how does the acting fare in this horrendous movie ? well 
 and i hoped for the best 
 and i imagine that 
 and i imagine this film gives me a pretty good idea . it's something i don't think has been the subject of a film . second 
 and i just didn't appreciate any of the tragic characters or anything that the film had to say . am i too much of a simpleton 
 and i kept leaning over and asking him happened 
 and i kept wondering why the other characters didn't just ditch this bitch . as for the obscenely photogenic zeta-jones 
 and i know that i've never said that before ( i thought i never would ) 
 and i liked the atmosphere of the school 
 and i mean years - around 13 or so - and went to an island in the carribean or something . he goes to her to finally get the divorce papers signed so he can remarry this . . . thing ( played with an emphasis on over-done by lolita davidovitch 
 and i quickly got bored . nic cage and gary sinise try to inject some life into some poorly realised characters 
 and i see something like this 
" and i think "" i still know "" has really suffered by not having him on board . the cool atmosphere is still there this time around "
 and i think that leonardo dicaprio actually did pretty well in the role of richard . mind you i think the rest of the cast that had some which had reasonably sized roles did equally well if not better . which begs the question why is leonardo paid so much ? ( i think this is a topic all on its own so i won't get into it ) . but i like the fact that there was an international cast used 
 and i think that's the source of the problem . many of his novels have become windy 
 and i was fascinated by the meticulous planning that must have been necessary to stage them effectively . we're introduced to our big burly hero one afternoon when he and some colleagues jump into the midst of a forest fire to save a group of people . during this sequence 
 and i was hoping to see more of her . further 
 and i was just hoping we could see the stupid squid . finally 
 and i was thinking that i would have fired him if he had done that to me . ( in addition 
 and i wish he and his character had gotten more screen time . okay 
 and i wish i had an idea of why people are seeing it . my guess is it's either an indication that 2000 was truly a terrible year for movies 
" and i wonder what will happen to those two cookie-cutter "" evil "" guys who have nothing in their system but hate and negativity . hmmmm "
 and i wouldn't call it giving away anything to say that by the picture's end 
 and i'd just like to shake the producers by the shoulders and scream 
 and i'll admit 
 and i'll even believe that g talks a talk that allows people to feel good about what they've bought . but 
 and i'll outline the sad history for you so you can get a sense for it . . . . 20th century fox nabs rights to successful video game for crossover hit ( mortal kombat

 and that is the girls themselves . the point is not that they can't act ( and 
 and that is this . . . he sure did put me in my place . with the second and third movie being bad 
 and that it had ended up in the mid-august dumping ground . then 
 and that it means something entirely different . also effective is the way zhang sets up tension within a scene 
 and that lara holds the key to time 
 and that may have implications for the outcome of the war . at the decisive moment of action 
 and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area . when she goes nosing around cromwell 
" and that message is basically all there is to "" the cell "" . singh tries to hide it behind bizarre visuals and overly dramatic dialogue "
 and that old standard 
 and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane . perhaps the only positive elements in the general's daughter are a couple of the performances . james woods has a few terrific scenes 
 and that reflects in the lack plot 
 and that remained so until oklahoma city bombing 
 and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after . this same exact problem occurred in last year's very 
 and that she's arrived as supergirl ( complete with appropriate costume ) . supergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives . ok . . . huh ? why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake ? attention movie : explain yourself ! i'm sorry 
 and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings . so 
 and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast 
 and that the coroner should check the man's lungs for chlorine . this is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him . you know what happens then ? nothing 
 and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy . yes 
 and that the input that others add to the script proves invaluable to the end product . letting them direct 
 and that the kidnapper/killer is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite a while . he is promptly removed from the case 
 and that the situation is hopeless . alas 
 and that they actually got people to agree to be in this film just depresses me even more . there are thousands of brilliant films out there that can't get distribution 
 and that they have been cheated and fooled . copyright ( c ) 2000 ian waldron-mantgani http : //members . aol . com/ukcritic 
 and that they just weren't paying attention . then they will slowly realise that 
" and that was just because it was so surreal . the rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it "" comedy . "" there is no set-up "
 and that was nine years ago . one entry was definitely enough 
 and that will be funny for about five minutes .  shucks . oh 
 and that will probably be it . using this approach 
 and that young paul will be groomed as the prophesied messiah to lead the fremen ( rogue desert warriors ) to salvation and freedom ? slobbering baron vladimir harkonnen ( ian mcneice ) 
 and that's about it . 
 and that's about the only level at which this film can be analyzed 
" and that's basically the whole of "" virus "" : one horribly-directed action scene after the other "
 and that's really a shame . the whole plot is a jumble - it's tough to care much about what's going on . the first one was fun 
 and that's the one at the unfortunate end of the cinematic totem pole . his second film was the critically acclaimed sundance sensation welcome to the dollhouse 
 and that's too bad . the acting is top notch 
" and the "" surprise "" ending feels like a swing from a ball-peen hammer into the temple . wahlberg does not have the physical or mental presence of a chuck heston to carry the film or any of its action sequences . this remake "
" and the acerbic comic genius dennis miller ( "" saturday night live "" ) would be involved in such a celluloid backfire as this turkey . not only are they in it "
 and the acting ability of former seattle seahawks linebacker brian bosworth . jones deserves better material and collaborators . it's a shame that double take is as bad as it is 
 and the acting is like the siberian steppes ? a film that drags more than a dropped anchor . but wait ! as if these problems don't make the film slow enough 
 and the acting is terrible . carol cheng has apparently won best actress honors at the hong kong movie awards in the past 
 and the action itself is an absolute catastrophe . director tsui hark ( who teamed with van damme in the superior 
 and the action scenes suffer from overkill 
 and the actors have to struggle to make it interesting . but the material is so fowl that even a rewrite by quentin tarantino couldn't help it . the whole time 
 and the actors in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear into . the bad thing about an actor turned director is that there's no one to restrain oldman from making poor choices . a good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film and the audience . oldman got it about half right . 
 and the actors providing the voice talent are enthusiastic ( though most are paired up with singers who don't sound a thing like them for their big musical moments -- jane seymour and celine dion ? ? ? ) . but one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good . aside from the fact that children will probably be as bored watching this as adults 
 and the actress that played marie was quite good . his friend sam 
" and the aforementioned human boiling sequence -- thrown in for good measure ) . some tried to write off "" mandingo "" as a blaxploitation film "
 and the alternately friendly / antagonistic police chief pat chambers ( paul sorvino ) 
 and the ants are threated by hopper to gather up a whole other season's load by the time the last summer leaf falls from the trees . banished from ant island 
 and the assination of the chinese ambassador 
 and the audience stares at the screen in complete confusion about who just bit the dust . allow me to now list everything that is wrong with this movie . the scenery is obviously fake and created mostly from models or really bad mat jobs ( watch for the mat job on a scene where a character falls off a cliff ; it's laughably bad ) . the special effects look like they were done on the same home computer used for the opening credits . the costumes consist of cheap looking furs for the humans and shoddy silver things for the aliens ( travolta manages to appear even more overweight in his costume ) . the battle scenes are shot entirely in slow motion and with no sound . these fights consist of watching humans and aliens getting hit by little white bursts of light which bounce off them but cause the victims to fall dead to the ground ( except jonnie tyler 
 and the beautiful 
 and the black actors of the past who did what they had to do - and having done so 
" and the boy . sometimes the script throws us tidbits of francis's wisdom which illuminate little while merely sounding insightful . ( "" i'm optimistic by nature . i'm optimistic about nothing . "" "" loneliness is my only true companion . "" ) we learn more details about francis's makeup techniques than about the man himself . he prefers shoe polish for his hair and sink cleaning powder for his teeth . full of metaphorical interpretations "
 and the brainy 
 and the camera tricks mostly apply to traveling up gun barrels as the weapons are fired . it all sounds very cool . trust me 
 and the capability behind the camera brought to mind such sparkling gems as `sleepless in seattle' and `unsung heroes' . meg ryan 
 and the captain 
 and the cast laughed out of the theater at its premier 
 and the catholic league will be angry . everyone else will see 'end of days' for what it is : a deliciously bad motion picture . think of it as hollywood's own y2k bug . did you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers 666 you'll get 999 
 and the cause is never made clear . someone thinks they've found a code book 
 and the character development is non existent ( reno plays the typical frenchman ( 'no croissant ? ' ) 
 and the characterization only adds to the difficulty . brenner 
 and the characterizations not much better . sorvino and company are as 2d as characters come 
 and the climax drags with mumbled revelations and laughable twists . some questions 
 and the cockney language . sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre 
" and the comedy is usually meant to work as catharsis for the violence . "" lethal weapon 2 "" ( 1989 ) is a perfect example of an action thriller that was also very "
 and the computer effects driving him 
 and the conclusion sports a halfway decent fistfight . the other 79 minutes 
 and the consistently ironical view of a world which is askew . it is certainly one of the most interesting films shown in the us in 1988 . ------------------------------------------------------- review written in 1988 . * 1996 addenda : ( 1 ) many sources in us film guides give it erroneously a 1985 release date . ( 2 ) the roald dahl story and/or its main trick found their way into tv programs of the alfred hitchcock presents type 
 and the costumes 
 and the creator of sil ( ben kingsley 
 and the effect is startling . but the script is beyond rescue . what hurts most is that hollywood continues to get away with serving up this tripe 
 and the effects crew did a decent job of making it look real . however 
 and the electric guitar . yahoo plays einstein as a naive and unrefined country hick--a clown with an insatiable curiosity . although yahoo's performance is at first endearing 
 and the electrical equipment is oddly working by itself . one survivor finally does turn up 
 and the emotional highlights 
 and the emotional value is slightly above that of a couple of valium . sorry 
 and the end result will be w . i . s . o . r . 
 and the ending climax falls off the cliff . it's too bad really 
 and the entertainment value is entirely unintentional . despite exuding charm from every pore 
 and the entire city of chicago ( the newspaper publishes an article about it ) . it turns out that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake ( kevin costner ) and so theresa travels to north carolina and tracks him down . he turns out to have a colorful father ( paul newman ) but is otherwise perfectly dull and overly obsessed with sailing . this is somehow attractive to theresa and the two begin their awkward courtship . of course she doesn't tell him that she found his letter 
 and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark . as i watched it 
" and the farrellys' script doesn't give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren't set up in any meaningful way . perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . zellweger's irene is not a strong female lead mary in "" mary "" may have been part adolescent fantasy "
 and the fbi . it occurred to me then what's wrong with indies like suicide kings : i suspect o'fallon has never met a mobster 
 and the film becomes an outer space _rambo_ 
 and the film focuses on him and the people who orbit around him . he spends his days hanging out with his friends at pubs and girlie bars . then 
 and the film has become well respected in cinema history . partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith's best if not his best . when the film's success called for sequels 
 and the film has plenty of flat moments 
 and the film is enthused with a passion for the back streets and the residents of this slice of suburbia . mansfield is inspired by the early films of godard and the french new wave 
 and the film isn't satisfying on any level beyond its visuals . the movie also has bad dialogue . if a critic says that a film has bad dialogue 
 and the film runs off its tracks . some have suggested that this isn't a problem 
 and the film seemed to work better in a single set anyway . the screenplay is o . k 
 and the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome . it grabbed my attention in the beginning and gradually lost it as it went on 
 and the film takes the form of one of the shoddier fill in the blank-from-hell flicks ever made . you can see through a great deal of martha's actions and lies from their conception ; why do people who have known this woman for years longer than we have never figure things out ? does nobody communicate or read the newspaper in this town ? if any of her potential victims thought 
 and the film ultimately moves at such a very 
 and the film was shot on location in eastern europe . one attraction of the film is its music 
 and the film's chase scenes are riddled with the cliches that _scream_ tried to subvert 
" and the film's director of photography . other extras include the "" jump to a nightmare "" feature ( i'm sure you can figure that one out ) "
 and the film's original theatrical trailer . some dvd-rom features are also included 
 and the film's pacing is worse than betty white running the boston marathon . the jokes are cheap 
 and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church . if you do any research at all about the gospel of st . thomas 
" and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of the proceedings interesting . "" switchback "" opens with the murder of a babysitter and the abduction of the young child she's watching . we learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse ( dennis quaid ) "
 and the filmmakers seem to assume that we will empathise with her simply because she's the main character 
 and the films what lies beneath and hannibal ( features that only faired adequately at the box office ) 
 and the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinely-funny family film . the unexpectedly high gross guaranteed a sequel 
 and the finished product resembles somewhat of a failed jigsaw puzzle . all the elements are there 
 and the first five minutes of the movie hum with untapped possibilites . then the plot got under way 
 and the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing and the generation of suspense . some of the acting is a burdensome area as well 
 and the formula for the film's script which followed the proverbial 1-2- 
 and the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many to list . to sum it up 
 and the gag behind the entire movie 
 and the guys kick him out of the house . this scene and another awful subplot involving tim's dead mother make up the dramatic core of the film 
 and the hero must play everything right or face disaster . it's a comedy--where adults are somewhat silly 
 and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago . this was the third one of '97 
 and the idea of a snowman that is alive works splendidly when animated 
" and the ill-fated "" dune "" ( 1984 ) . the director was richard fleischer "
 and the inevitable climactic meet which will decide everything . oh 
 and the intrusion of a stranger who kinda screws things up for them . loli and alain chabat ( victoria abril and alain chabat ) are not exactly happily married . always on business trips 
 and the jackal . willis isn't terrible 
 and the job is nearing completion . nekichi's son kametaro futori ( choichiro kawarazaki ) is understandably confused about his heritage 
 and the large knees were supposed to represent goat legs . i'm not quite sure how reynolds thought this up 
 and the lethal weapon movies 
 and the like . ( there are 
 and the like . sounds like a cool movie 
 and the lip sync is pretty good . you'd have no problem guessing that most of the close up's are puppets 
 and the long dormant sequel has finally emerged . unfortunately 
 and the low-tech special effects kept in . the original television programme was on a limited budget 
 and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped and simplified . jet li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen and aalyah has a magical voice . their achievement save this film from being completely braindead 
 and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria 
 and the man who is sleeping with his daughter ( affleck ) . once they reach space 
 and the mess at ruby ridge . consciously or not 
 and the mile-high flames ensued about three minutes afterward . in general 
 and the more they become involved 
 and the movie dredges up more cliche and less believability with each successive scene . what can you expect from a movie whose entire premise is that two parents can't find a rare toy on christmas eve 
 and the movie gets some good laughs out of everyone reacting to her total guilelessness . there is also one moment -- maybe salvaged from an earlier 
 and the movie would turn out exactly the same 
 and the movie's head-scratcher of a send-off confirms this . there is some good to be found amongst this mess 
 and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively . and when that patient finally dies ( spoiler alert ! ) 
 and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme . did the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie ? instead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film 
 and the music sounds like your mom's techno 
 and the name of an obstetrician who's been in the business 66 . 6 years . meanwhile 
 and the newly departed are spared seven years of tribulation during the antichrist's rise to global power . those who have been left behind must struggle in the ultimate battle between good and evil 
 and the ninth film in the series 
 and the occasional dramatic moments are the least bit touching . it is not charming or entertaining in any way . and then to top it off 
 and the only reason you go to see one of his films anyway . if you've never seen a jackie chan movie 
 and the only saving grace 
 and the only thing he has going for him is terminal cuteness . he's not half as interesting as macaulay culkin once was . the villains 
 and the only thing i am able to say about it is that van damme plays a dude named ray 
 and the other kidnappers . the story 
 and the pacing is way off . when one is stuck in a theater for an hour and a half watching what claims to be a motion picture 
 and the payoff is a big let down . the martian ghosts - really dustlike particles that take over humans - create an army of zombies who run around shouting and killing colonists . the army also is a rip-off of the anonymous gangbangers who were mowed down during precinct 13 . even what is supposed to pass for witty repartee between henstridge's ballard and ice cube's williams seems forced . the chemistry factor is zero . carpenter does add a couple of interesting touches . ballard and her mouthy subordinate 
 and the performances are completely uninspired . that's the main problem with the avengers : for all it's hip-hop flash and tidal waves 
 and the phantom phreak ( renoly santiago ) 
 and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts . only some special effects sequences show the wear of time 
 and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly 
 and the players seem to know even less . i didn't laugh 
 and the playwright contributes the clunky script 
 and the plot is extremely predictable . the way the film progresses 
 and the plot isn't affected in any way . the sequence also suffers from a few plot holes ( as does the rest of the film ) : why is the ship's computer ( which sounds strangely like hal from 
 and the plotting of the movie are so predictable and laughable 
 and the pointless 10-year- old buster attempting to add some sort of home alone cuteness to the whole thing . appearances by musical legends such as aretha franklin 
" and the pointless middle of "" stigmata "" "
 and the pokemon fans will dig every minute of this film . for those parents and/or brothers and sisters who have to sit through this . . . bring a pillow . reviewed by brandon herring 4/11/01 http : //us . imdb . com/reviewsby ? brandon + herring 
 and the police are hot on harry's trail . harry suddenly realizes he has been framed while others have taken the ransom money . can he get out of this mess ? opinion : palmetto is a long 
 and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny . unfortunately 
 and the really funny scenes are worth noting . still 
" and the recent "" godzilla "" remake -- should not have been assigned an epic about the american revolutionary war . it's nonetheless unsurprising that my opening maxim never occurred to anyone involved with "" the patriot "" . after all "
 and the relationship is forgotten about and the film focuses on the soccer team and the tension between chester and his boss . this film could've been less bad had it been the cliche sports comedy 
 and the relationship seems rushed because of this . when they get close to kissing 
 and the reluctant husband plan a brinks-type robbery . it nets them an armored vehicle and guard uniforms . the two men impersonate the money-collectors . carol operates the communications system with admirable presence of mind . the first part of the film is cool 
 and the result is a film that fails in both aspects . action scenes are sometimes interesting 
 and the result is a movie that leaves you exhausted rather than exhilarated . the numerous action scenes are loud and headache-inducing and the frenetic pacing never slows down enough for us to care about what's going on in the movie . and much of what's going on is just wacky . there's a whole segment devoted to net-surfing monks that i have yet to figure out . and the climax finds quinn going head-to-head with a tiger in the roman coliseum while yaz circles them on a motorcycle 
 and the result is less like a movie and more like a derailed train . at least we have chow yun-fat in the lead role . chow plays nick chen 
 and the result is really memorable : the shining 
 and the result was refreshing . no such luck with `down to you' . it's just a textbook romance where 
 and the routine operation turns into shootout that would leave federal officers that . that brings fbi on the scene 
 and the scenes on tasmania are often clever . but after the first twenty minutes 
 and the script does no justice to his wonderful comic ability . catherine zeta-jones ( always nice to look at ) is given the woefully underwritten role of a bi-sexual insomniac that gets to run out of her bedroom perplexed every time some strange noise occurs . liam neeson pops in from time to time to talk into his tape recorder and attempt to convince the others that he has as much knowledge about what's going on as the rest of them do . finally 
 and the search for one's place in the universe 
 and the second is botched up by the asinine ending . perhaps theaters ought to screen only the first section 
 and the sequel's effects crew at steve johnson's xfx inc . keeps that high-quality tradition alive ; no cheap-looking lost in space cgi here . after the effects 
 and the shot sequence of dave - car falling - dummy gets crushed by car gets very old 
 and the shouting matches get hideously dull . the spook scenes are short and far between 
 and the sight and sound of the still-heavily-accented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way . even typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug . paul sorvino is unconvincing and terribly overwrought as schneider's cia superior ; and lela rochon 
 and the sight of helgenberger's character performing fellatio on madsen's 
 and the sky runs red with blood ( actually 
" and the sleazepin director of such open-crotch classics as "" basic instinct "" and the infamous "" showgirls "" never lets a little credibility get in the way of his voyeuristic tendencies which "
 and the sooner 
 and the soulful black pizza owner ( from the last dragon 
 and the special effects are decent enough . there's also a pleasant soundtrack . buried deep in the dross are one or two amusing jokes . and salma hayek pops up as the female interest 
 and the story wanders aimlessly looking for a new plot to pick up on . when bess discovers what's really going on she breaks up with chester 
 and the strange editing 
 and the stunts 
 and the super-streamlined plot line ( john brown is injured and becomes superhuman crime-fighting machine ) is stolen completely from robocop . how's that for your average kiddie movie ? two funny items of note earn gadget its half-star . first is the minion recovery group scene 
" and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that i wondered whether they all participated in some kind of "" free lobotomy "" lab experiment . woo is a spontaneous "
 and the symbolism is obvious . tectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth 
 and the talent of the rest of the sequel's cast is impossible to determine given the stupefying mediocrity of rafael moreu's script . as rachel 
 and the terminator films are the most plagiarized ) ; more importantly 
 and the terror is gone . 'three years later' appears on the screen 
 and the thin script makes all of them easy to guess . the plot 
 and the third is a 30-something loser 
 and the thoughts aren't too kosher . first off 
 and the tone of the film in general is more infantile . unfortunately 
 and the tunes 
 and the twist is pathetic and startlingly obvious when it arrives . lacking the strong characters seven featured 
 and the twists keep on coming as the film progresses . unfortunately 
 and the two have to run all over pittsburgh ( which is obviously not really pittsburgh ) to get away with their perfect crime . norm sleeps with some girl in a bit part that should have been bigger 
 and the upcoming notting hill ) 
 and the upcoming the mighty ! ) 
 and the usual cast and crew biographies . the film itself might not be the greatest 
 and the various lives he affects . but while the characters 
 and the violence is only intended to punctuate the laughs . unfortunately 
 and the wartime setting simply a convenient backdrop . there is no genuine exploration of what pearl harbor meant to the united states 
 and the way it's executed here 
 and the western genre has almost evaporated . even cowgirls get the blues and wild wild west are some of the most recent entries 
 and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably . the film also makes the tragic mistake that a man ( in this case kline ) in a dress is automatically unfunny 
 and the whole thing turned into a tv cop show . the plot features a cop -- james caan -- and his new alien partner ( mandy patinkin ) . caan lost his last partner to an alien grocery-store robber 
 and the whole town comes to watch . the town's prodigal son charlie ( hank azaria ) wrote an article on the weekly game for sports illustrated . mystery's national fame has the town abuzz . a week later 
 and the workers aren't the only ones there 
 and their fashion sense is incomprehensibly glam . though they're not overtly transvestites 
 and their love . as an added emotional bonus 
 and their performances are uncomfortable 
 and their vacation begins . karla brings along tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) and reluctant julie is forced into bringing will ( matthew settle ) because her old boyfriend ray ( freddie prinze jr . ) has to work . apparently julie still can't get over the fact that they cut off ben willis's hand and threw him into the water to drown in the last movie but 
 and then 
" and then "" stir of echoes "" had its moments "
 and then a hapless crew on a tug discovers the derelict ship and tries to salvage it . no more needs to be said as to what happens and where the conflict lies 
" and then about to take him out for a bit of "" catch "
 and then all but evaporate from the screen . 100 minutes seems like 30 
 and then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrusts . there is one crucial difference 
" and then come a grand series of plot twists so asinine you'll want to join in with the laughter and mockery of the audience if only doing so didn't make this movie even worse . its desperate earnestness makes it even more laughable ( with none other than craig t . "" coach "" nelson lording over it all ) "
 and then decided to actually take the time to write it out . evil small town films are pretty common ( the last one 
 and then dumping them . kathryn ( sarah michelle gellar ) 
 and then emmerich cuts to a wide shot to show the boat blow up . how the hell did that happen ? did they throw a hand grenade ? where did they find one of those 
 and then feels really guilty .  this is a serious problem in real life 
 and then goes downhill from there ? angel cop is like a bad version of sylvester stallone's cobra fused with a really low-rent rip-off of the first power and some robocop thrown in for good measure -- which is really saying something 
 and then having to heal lucy's anger when she finds out . even when elton is concentrating on the ivf storyline 
 and then he can feel guilty .  then 
 and then he gets entangled in a big violent chase 
 and then he's thrown through some type of time-space wormhole which crashes lands on the twentieth century fox studio backlot 
 and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky 
 and then helen will be expendable 
 and then is devastated when her husband is hit by a truck and killed ( come to think of it 
 and then is no longer able to rake his lawn ! we actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard . other things that bugged me about 8mm : one would be the music 
" and then just pound your first into your forehead in total disbelief at what you're witnessing . it's so awful it's downright charming ; it's about as bad and as * loud * as stargate . here's the "" plot "" : scientists recieve a transmission from space that seems to consist of a genetic code . after synthesizing it and crossbreeding it with human dna "
 and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent . the grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point . the movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences 
 and then no one 
 and then one more star vehicle in eraser two years after that . so then he thought 
 and then relay the target's position 
 and then rewritten until it could make us care about it . what we have here is an excruciatingly unnecessary film . critical rating : ( 1/2 ) * rated pg-13 
 and then saw a bunch of careless bastards trample it into bloody pulp . copyright ( c ) 2000 ian waldron-mantganiplease visit 
 and then seconds later he's running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong . why ? who knows . what are the implications of this ? i have no idea . most action films abandon depth in favor of action 
 and then she'll get called back !  yessssss !  so 
 and then she's out . rated r ( almost got an nc-17 ) for explicit sexual dialogue and nudity . check out more current movie reviews at http : //www . indra . com/~mmapes/ 
 and then show him drinking pepto bismol when he's stewing over his girl trouble . as for avital 
 and then someone saw it and made up a story to go along with it . the title sequence is so good 
 and then something bad happens 
 and then somewhere else 
" and then the ultimate showdown : was that my wife i saw you with last night ? director mike newell ( "" four weddings and a funeral "" ) must have read a different draft of this script because the one that's being acted out up there between newark "
 and then think of a subject to go with it . it seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had a similar train of thought when it came to the title sequence . i wouldn't be surprised if a couple of guys got together and created the opening credits 
 and then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it . awful decision there joel . another is cage's performance . at this point he's capable of a wide range of performances 
 and then throw in drug-dealing pirates to provide for a few high-level action sequences and explosions .  there are good scripts out there that high-profile actors can make ( see the truman show 
 and then thrown away just as quickly . the main piece of the story 
 and then we can all go home 
 and then we're forced to discard it and start from absolute scratch . this is annoying . when we finally do understand what the sam hill is going on 
 and then with a town deputy 
 and there are fights 
 and there are many hints of this throughout . unfortunately 
 and there are moments in frears' film that kumble imitates almost completely ( such as the last scene 
 and there are no vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity in them . just because the protagonist 
 and there are strong hints that he is probably the killer as well -- after all 
" and there is much less gore than in "" the lost world "" "
 and there is no real focus for anything 
 and there is no rhyme or reason for what it does in order to do so . the film never explains why the argonauticus is attacked in the first place . it simply happens . the action scenes are decent 
 and there is no sense of realism about the character . the 'humour' in the film is also very off . will smith put a little spin to his daft lines in men in black 
 and there is too much violence for little children . nice example is the humorous scene in the beginning 
 and there isn't a genuine laugh to be found from the beginning to the end ( unless 
 and there isn't even an attempt to flesh out the characters . james woods can be a good actor 
 and there just isn't much that can be done about that ( unless you're obsessive like george lucas ) . the new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places 
 and there was actually a bigger snake waiting to make its appearance just when everyone thought they were safe . no such luck . okay 
 and there were many different things that could have been done with the story . so what did the writers choose to do ? why 
 and there's a few nice special effect shots 
 and there's a remote chance it will strike 
 and there's an 'hilarious' running gag about siskel and ebert . ( the mayor is mayor ebert 
 and there's really a better movie waiting to make its debut . 
 and there's still a struggle - for the audience to follow or even care about the story . it isn't the end until audiences have witnessed a half-baked romance 
 and therefore 
 and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown . in a case like that 
 and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations ( spillane 
 and therefore can not act . they are nothing more than two celebrities put together . the other actors 
 and therefore he pretty much fits his role to a t 
 and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles . i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film . based on what the film told me 
 and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and 
 and these folks just didn't snag this one correctly . they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept 
 and these guys are sailors 
 and these two obnoxious youngsters are no exception . it's hard to dislike a film as good-natured as this one is 
 and they apparently don't like to be roped or something ( hey 
 and they are fun 
 and they are respectively played by claire danes 
 and they are treated accordingly . twenty years ago 
 and they are used as cheap labor by the psychlos 
 and they certainly don't show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture . these scenes are not the least bit powerful ; on the contrary 
 and they check out all the suspects on the base 
 and they chew the scenery like you've never seen . barry pepper 
 and they convene in vince's seedy 
 and they do so by means of brainless subplots . first 
 and they don't even give him falsies . brandis doesn't bother to mimic a girl's voice either . then there is a pointless scene where chester and matthew shop for a dress 
 and they don't swim the few metres back to their sub 
" and they get even worse when the pair arrives at a swanky restaurant to enjoy a "" quiet "" dinner . in the one-hundred year history of motion pictures "
 and they go to battle . i think that i laughed exactly twice in start the revolution without me . the film obviously has some problems 
 and they go to live with their two zany aunts ( stockard channing and dianne wiest ) . switch to the present day 
 and they have a big showdown against the drug dealers and kod at the high school . ok 
 and they have him mouth dialogue that's an utter embarrasement to an actor as good as him ) . sorvino has a scene which so far outshines the rest of the movie 
 and they help it out a lot . and there are some funny parts ( like 
 and they hold little chemistry for each other or the audience . max is played without any style by david schwimmer . schwimmer 
 and they might even have saved the film had barbieri's direction not bungled the job so completely . sadly . kane picoy's portrayal of nick is one-dimensional and bland 
 and they outdo themselves this time as q ( desmond llewelyn--who has played q since 1964's * goldfinger * ) presents bond with a car he can operate with a finger on a touchpad on his cellular phone . judi dench continues nicely as bond's boss tough m 
 and they sink to the ultimate form of lamentation : they clean house . bitter salt tears course down their cheeks as they ajax the bathtub and bab-o the pots and pans 
 and they slowly get absorbed into amercan society ( i'm assuming american society 
 and they still went ahead with the project 
 and they two kinda hit it off . so she decides she will get back at alain chabat by doing the obvious : sleeping with marijo . but she soons starts to not only fall in love with marijo 
 and they use the humans to do so . jonnie tyler 
 and they were significantly stronger films . 
 and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person . the film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly 
 and they're not even that great . as a side note 
 and thin lizzy . then again 
 and think of v . d . violent things happen . after a lull 
 and think they're just a bunch of harmless young tarts . during one botched heist of a magazine office 
" and this "" serious "" angle seems to come from an entirely different movie . unlike wayans's last starring vehicle "
" and this . what could have been a clever little sex comedy turns into one mess of a french flick . "" french twist "" ( the "" cool "" american title "
 and this bad movie does little to resolve my unanswerable query . kingpin ( 8/10 ) successfully stepped through such a community last year 
 and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career . chris o'donnell is not as bad an actor as casper van dien but that is not saying a great deal . he seems held back and really doesn't get into his character much and after even the first 30 minutes gets annoying and old . artie lange just to me seems like he is trying to another chris farley and was completely unfunny and un-nerving . why the filmmakers would want to waste such a cast in such a bad movie 
 and this could partially explain his work here . however 
 and this difficulty in following the action works against its entertainment value . but perhaps the worst thing that can be said about the car chases is that they lead up to the film's routine 
 and this film does in fact realize that . it gets its message across and it does it effortlessly . now it just needs to work as a film . which it doesn't . it's too sloppy and too contrived . it paints a bleak portrait of high school life . . . then lets it lie . it brings us a bunch of scary monsters who are all a bunch of disgustingly icky kiss-ups who do food drives and hang out at a 50s diner drinking milk shakes . . . then gives it a cheap twist : when they get horny 
 and this film really needed it to be on one side or the other . rose mcgowan is cold and unpleasant to the eye as always 
 and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen or director warren clarke . the only not so forgettable element in this film is presence of former supermodel rosie vela 
 and this is mostly due to the presence of spastic motormouth tucker . this is tucker's first leading role 
 and this is normally a problem . knock off 
 and this is ultimately a dull and meandering film . some people may find its easy going style charming and endearing 
 and this is where big daddy really goes from bad to hideous . the court scene at the end of the film is useless and unbelievable 
 and this joyful miracle only seems like an attack by a demonic force because the priest is so darn angry at the state of the vatican . this is ridiculous 
 and this leads to a custody battle . opinion : it's a movie about an embittered creep teaching a little kid to be a jerk 
 and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers 
 and this movie should have known better than to blatantly confuse the two . i also resented the way the kid's emotional problems are used for a cheap payoff . at the end of the movie 
 and this one is coming right along to join them . what starts out like a promising desert film ( martin scorsese is one of the producers ) turns into boring drech . pete calder ( crudup 
" and this one is just as bad as the rest . "" strapped "" tells us the story of diquan "
 and this one is really shallow ( seemed to be geared that way as well ) 
 and this one surprised me the most 
 and this rogaine-nightmare is loose and after the dog and the girl . meanwhile 
 and this role interested him 
 and this scene is symptomatic of the film's overall lack of rhythm and style . far from a breath of fresh air for contemporary australian cinema 
 and this time they're capitalizing on plane crashes 
 and this unnecessary plot development sticks out like a sore thumb ( tellingly 
 and this was what was left over . 
 and this year 
 and this year's flubber . now 
 and those are the strengths of the corruptor . but the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense 
" and those guys know what they're talking about . "" up at the villa "" feels like it was made to prove the point . if you removed every bit of its dialogue that strains to make sure we understand obvious details "
 and those who stick with this film for its entire length will be forced to endure the prolonged company of this wretched trio . and 
" and those will most likely be people who have already seen one or more of the following movies : "" 2001 : a space odyssey "
 and though we are meant to be looking at the 'dark belly' of the porn industry 
 and thrills 
 and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury club . there 
 and thumbs down--way 
 and thurman ) then take the problem a step further 
 and thus haven't seen this stuff before ) . i can't imagine anyone with a reasonable attention span being more than momentarily distracted by this pointless adventure . maybe that's why the only ones laughing at the screening i attended were still in their thumb-sucking years . 
 and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow . take 
 and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police . woods relishes the role of a man whose job is playing with people's minds 
 and tin men 
 and to add to his problems 
 and to be honest 
 and to collect the money ( of which he gets to keep 10% ) . but 
 and to dispense nastily and sarcastically to all : students 
 and to search for the man who killed his parents 14 years earlier . this puts him in conflict with the formidable febre ( tim roth ) 
 and to some extent chubby checker come across as egotistical jerks--surely not the director's intention . the film kicks off with the early 1950s 
 and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr . ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) and the religious spokesman palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) . the film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals . the portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable ( albeit less immediately engaging ) than 
 and to top it off charlie has been making eyes at his wife . crowe is not given a lot of room to act in this film 
 and told so bombastically 
 and too many jokes about a glass eye 
 and totally unfunny ( yes 
 and trading in fleshed out 
 and treat it as a parody of typical action fare 
 and tremors to name a few ) . so 
 and tries to drop out of life with his migraine medication . only the killer tracks him down 
 and tries to revive their old cat-and-mouse game

 and two kids create their own universe . it's sort of like a horror story

 and ultimately make no sense . for example

 and unconventional camera angles

 and unintentionally humorous 
 and unless you're a big fan of either cage or flash directing 
 and unpleasant without making you feel entertained are just some ways to describe '8mm' which is artificial entertainment disguised as a wannabe thriller that had audiences i saw with it 
 and upon arrival on earth patrick is mating like crazy 
 and use it as a metaphor to project the image of good story telling . '8mm' goes right for the jugular in all the wrong ways and looks a lot like a big budget porno film and can be described as a movie becoming a victim of its own subject matter that wallows in the excess of its own seediness and has little room for the audience to react in anything more than standard fashion . the film at times just seems to be going through the motions with wooden direction 
 and usually gets killed by the disaster . it's okay 
 and various other people intersect the four romantically 
 and very few laughs . farley engages in his usual shtick of falling down and bellowing 
" and victoria abril is pretty likable despite the script ( and the fact that she's stupid enough to try to divide herself over two people when she has kids ) . and alain chabat has some funny moments as the neurotic husband . but "" french twist "" is just pretty lame . it's not overly horrible "

 and watching harry's bumbling confidence amounts to an irritating distraction . there's a lapse in concentration in the middle of the movie as the camera goes wild on breasts 
 and we all get cheap laughs because for 90 minutes the innocent kindergartner never finds out what it means when he mimics all the bad boy behavior . that's the essence of big daddy . but there's a bigger issue involved : marketing . movies that are rated pg and pg-13 are heavily marketed towards children of preteen age and below . on tv 
 and we are left wondering if he should still be executed or not . wow . how interesting  . the plot's utter predictability is also at fault here with one guess as to whom is to get healed by the gentle monster in this film ( we are told that one certain lady has a tumor early on in the movie ) . whip out those thinking caps

 and yet it's somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it -- the premise is both promising and intriguing . too bad the execution's all wrong 
 and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son . whatever . to be fair 
 and yet none of them seem like actual people . professor john robinson ( hurt ) is the intelligent 
 and yet somehow nothing is ever fleshed out . the three sisters never have a conversation that tells us anything about their personalities -- all their lines are questions 
 and yet there are sneering villains 
 and yet totally predictable !  imagine that . don't get me wrong -- six days 
 and you are unfortunate enough to go and witness it 
 and you can hardly blame him . there's a few well-staged chase scenes through the forest where the camera whirls

 bad wardrobe and a gold cell phone 
 badly burnt boy staggers down a street . just as you think that he'll fall down dead 
 badly made . the direction is hamfisted . the acting is without merit . the writing is on about the same level as that roomful of typewriter-endowed chimpanzees . it is amusing that the movie is set at a film school 
" badly written script and fantastic animation . the first film came out the end of 1999 and was a huge hit grossing almost $90 million domestically . a sequel soon followed and even made $45 million . warner has released their third movie based on the immensely popular video game and tv series and its a waste of time and celluloid . this time ash ketchum and his friends are on their way to the johto battles ( which my little brother told me the new spinoff is "" pokemon : the johto journeys "" so go figure ) anyway he comes in contact with a young girl who's father has disappeared after trying to discover the unown . they are small pokemon with a powerful punch and have great psychic abilities . the unown bring together their psychic abilities and create entei a powerful legendary pokemon who barriers young molly's house and creates every wish she wants . now it's up to ash and his friends to stop this pokemon entei and show him to be a good pokemon rather than a bad one . too bad really that this is a bad movie "

 beat him up 
 beaten up 
 beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts . the action is a mixed bag here . there's really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackie's films . it takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site 
 beatrice foods' corporate counsel 
 beatty has instead made a film where bulworth rambles about our unbalanced society without telling us anything about how he intends to improve it . that is often the true nature of politicians and if the movie wants to do that 
 beatty has made an abysmal failure of a film the has absolutely no after thought and is as stimulating as frozen silly putty . 
 beautiful 
 beauty can sometimes dissolve into tedium . so it is with paulie . when they let their bird do his stand-up comedy routines 
 bebe neuwirth . rated r . summer of sam will be remembered as a waste of spike lee's abilities . lee is a great filmmaker 
 became a real laugh-free dead-zone 
 became obsessed with the rise of fascism . which wasn't so hard to expect 
" because "" honest "" does not give us a convincing re-creation of its time . it doesn't so much take place in the 60s as in one of those "" austin powers "" -style pieces of production design overkill that pretend to be the 60s by teeming with joints "
 because despite some unnecessary marlon brandon-like mumbling 
" because director william friedkin's probably most acclaimed film was "" the exorcist "" which had a silly story "
 because each of them would likely give you a different answer . fight club means what you want it to mean 
 because he ( or she ) has a peculiar notion of eroticism . sure 
 because he gives a brilliantly accurate performance 
 because he plays exactly the same character here 
 because he's just too big to avoid clumsiness . joe 
 because he's obviously a good director . i'm more inclined to point my finger at robert pucci's script 
 because her fiance will already have cheated on her !  then 
 because his character becomes nicer throughout the film . however 
 because his niece is one of the victims . it's a slobbering psychopath 
" because his role is small enough and sporadic enough to not tarnish his credibility . he seems to be in here just to give it a cool "" law and order "" feeling ( even if it's not a "" cool "" feeling ) . and in cameos are b-rated erotic-thriller-cinemax-style stars "
 because his tales are grounded in the basics of life and human nature . and as long as love 
 because i 
" because i didn't hear any girls swooning . the talented anthony anderson ( "" me "
 because i don't know that much about him . i only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk 
 because i don't want to go off on a two hour rant about how awful this movie was . first 
 because i like both of these guys . kutcher is a dopey highlight on the fox sitcom that '70s show 
" because i wrote down plenty of other bad ones ( "" if it weren't for me "
 because if it were not for that 
 because if the finished motion picture product is anything to go by 
 because inevitably people do find out about the place 
" because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . "" me "
 because it got a big laugh . qu ying 
 because it has a promising appearance 
 because it lacks sensuality . not dramatic 
 because it lacks the acting . and not intelligent because it lacks a story . it is simply verhoven's bad excuse for making pornography . you want to see naked women ? bare breasts ? full frontals ? it's nothing wrong with that . but in that case i suggest that you rent a porn film in your local video store 
 because it may just be one of the funnier thrillers of the year . 
 because it might have lent some better characterization to the narrative . this is jan de bont's second straight misfire ( speed 2 : cruise control being the first ) . when is he going to learn that bigger is not always necessarily better ? robert wise knew that when he made the original and the makes of the blair witch project also knew that . one should not approach a haunted house movie with a twister mindset . if de bont and screenwriter david self had let our minds fill in the blanks as to what was happening instead of showing us everything 
 because it shows us more of sly than stone . now let's guess who we'd rather see naked 
 because it took this new license to extremes that many argued surpassed what was in the book . rest assured 
 because it' s evident that they're all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie . edward furlong has done far better work than this 
 because it's a parable that we've heard way too many times before . the writer 
 because it's just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy . it proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality 
 because it's not at all scary . however 
 because it's only interesting for about five minutes . i'm not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow-motion 
 because it's too busy drowning in jackass cliches and godawful writing to ever manage a statement of purpose . it's one part western 
 because its creature 
 because maybe then i would have enjoyed myself more . instead 
 because none of the characters are well-formed ( a common failing in anything penned by crichton 
 because of his many sitcom roles 
 because of his own raging libido 
 because of it's inconclusive and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere 
 because of love for the tv show ; then refuse to believe it's bad 
 because of the lack of written description 
 because of the poor editing and the cheap sets and props that give away the low budget . in short 
 because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie ) 
 because she is the one who stayed by her father's side as everyone else moved forward to pursue a impending career . georgia ( keaton ) 
 because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild . hammond 
 because sitting through this movie was sheer punishment . here's the plot . ricky ( jeff goldblum ) is producer of the good-buy network 
" because some of the lines in it were so bad and obviously "" written "" "
 because sometimes that's the best way to illustrate what a film is like . it's absolutely essential here ; the dialogue is the key point 
 because that's the depth of the most fully- developed character in this painfully generic creature feature . deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer . in fact 
 because the actors are so irritating 
 because the developments in the story fly by with no satisfying payoffs . at one point 
 because the farrelly brothers' brand of humor doesn't require plot to work . they're wrong 
 because the movie has very little plot . the characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) 
 because the on-screen talent -- including the pairing of gwyneth paltrow and jessica lange -- is nothing to laugh at . paltrow and johnathon schaech play helen and jackson 
 because the only thing that i ended up caring about during this entire picture was the obscene amount of fat that tom hanks has been able to burrow under his loose chin . furthermore 
" because the set-up of "" desperate measures "" boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use . san francisco cop frank connor ( garcia ) is a single parent with a troubling dilemma -- his son matt ( joseph cross ) is stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission . even worse "
 because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable . even though frankie page's life is falling apart before her very eyes 
 because the social turmoil of 1960s and economic decline of 1970s seemed to be the breeding ground for many dangerous ideologies . in such times 
 because there are ship 
 because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story . maybe it's an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever . the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over 
 because there's nothing going on . and 
 because they are desperate to save the woman's life . suicide kings is a terrible film . walken aside 
 because they do everything the movie demands of them . sadly 
 because they had to pretend that it all made sense . baldwin is the most embarrassing -- wandering around on his own 
 because they run the risk of making it so personal that other people won't understand it . but that's just not true -- think of the wonderful movies made by such auteurs as the coen 
 because they'd have plenty of free space in which to insert a comprehensible story . kristin scott thomas stars as mary panton 
 because this cinematic travesty was written and directed by george gallo 
 because this film equals $8 and 103 minutes lost . 
" because this is a "" family film "
 because this is a six-hour epic ! all of the shoddy production elements would be forgiven if there was a halfway decent cast holding this house of cards together . hurt wanders through early scenes mumbling his lines 
 because this is an action film . they aren't 
 because this is perfectly suited to be an all out action fest . the director 
 because this way less people will have to sit through this dreadful little comedy . and no 
 because we all think he got what he deserved . if you're going to be unoriginal 
 because while enjoyable cheese like `dragonheart' and the moderate stallone thriller `daylight' aren't superior cinema 
" because you have to wonder how much time its creators actually spent at one . the only positive thing that can be said about "" urban legends "" is that "
 because you'll know they aren't . basing the show on a 1960's television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom

 but .1
 but 100 minutes of bloodshed here isnt ? oy . . . the hypocrisy continues . if anything 
 but 101% more satisfying . 
 but _snl_ producer lorne michaels 
 but `hanging up' should have at least been enjoyable . uh-uh . it's a wrong number from the beginning . 
 but a complete rewrite would have been better . and 
 but a different person nonetheless . if ever you rent this movie one day ( promise you won't throw away your hard-earned money at the theaters ? ! ) 
 but a gorgeous apartment . he convinces his wife 
 but a juxtaposition of scenes that serve no purpose other than to plug in all the required elements ( such as plot 
 but a peace treaty is signed between the two godfathers . it is at this point that han ( the romeo of the story ) finds out about his brother's death . escaping from a prison in china 
 but a personal link to her past as well . the setup shows promise 
 but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage . 
" but a search for it turned up a wildeism more germane to the film : "" there is no sin "
 but a significant portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several recognizable actors ( as opposed to being diverted into the special effects ) . michael madsen and marg helgenberger 
 but a smitten andy seeks her out . however

 but a very lousy movie . [pg] 
 but advertised as 'family entertainment' -- not only insult children's intelligence 
 but after appearing in `snake eyes' and this vomit-inducing sham 
 but after something like the pagemaster 
 but after the man becomes a wealthy doctor 
 but again she can only pull off one expression 
 but again the movie is all style and no substance and by the ending finale climax i was ready to go home . only a few things work here and those are a few of the performances 
 but alas 
 but alas in the end it wasn't . dennis dugan's direction is all right 
 but alas there was still 35 more minutes to go . daniel baldwin ( i can't believe i'm about to type this ) gives the best performance in the film 
 but all he could come up with is plenty of slo-mo action 
 but all i know is that he was born in las vegas in 1969 and played the character of billy bathgate in the 1991 film of the same name . jason lee was born in the state of california in the year of 1971 . he was a professional skateboarder before his acting career took off after mallrats ( 6/10 ) 
 but all i noticed was the message being shoved in my face . what was this message that i refer to with such bitterness ? simply 
 but all i remember is--and i kid you not--graphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world 
 but all i saw was one of those b movies they show on uhf stations at 3 a . m . it is a fair attempt at making a good 
 but all of the humor falls astoundingly flat 
 but all that means is an opportunity for twice as many pratfalls . this time 
 but all the actors here 
 but all this creates is an eyesore . for some reason 
 but almost all of them end up directly intertwined with the story . perhaps i should have issued a spoiler alert before mentioning that 
 but also by his very disturbed mother ( kathy bates - what is the world coming to ? ) . granted 
 but also not much different from his recurring role of phoebe's brother on friends . actually 
 but also pretty dumb . you especially get this sense that he's dumb after brandi tells him she killed her husband for allegedly abusing her . ( i'd put my pants on in two seconds after that ! ) now 
 but also some of the low-tech tools used by pirates and vikings . immediately the film's biggest flaw is apparent : are these people primitive or highly advanced ? it doesn't seem like anyone can read yet they have ski-doos and airplanes ! how are these things powered ? and if they have airplanes 
" but also some seriously bad dialogue . it all adds up to a really terrible movie that made me laugh in plenty of places i wasn't supposed to and grimace in places i was supposed to laugh . one more thing fair game has against it is some awful comic relief . would you laugh at a scene where crawford tortures a computer nerd with double entendres like "" i'm very interested in _hard_ware "" and other crap about playing with his joystick ? i wouldn't "
 but also starred and did his own stunts . his creation is about as stupid and contrived as you'd expect from someone named yahoo . the movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating einstein's youth . whereas the scientist actually hailed from germany 
 but also their monosyllabic dialogue and empty-headed character motivations . in panel-sized morsels 
 but also totally dismisses one of his principals' established characterisation . as mindless summer entertainment 
 but also unfair . what director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking . one of the earliest apparent problems with 'rules of engagement' is its lack of credibility . the entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now 
 but also very on-par with an original . but i do have a big problem with remakes that are blatantly bad . you see 
 but also with a once-famous black humor story by roald dahl 
 but always seems to self-destruct at the crucial moment . so 
 but an ex-con with a history of bilking wealthy women of their money . emily is a prime target : she's worth over $100 million . steven's solution to his predicament is to offer david half a million to kill his wife . the artist accepts and the movie is underway . drawing from frederick knott's play and loosely based on hitchcock's dial m for murder

 but appears only briefly 
 but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward . a very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language . some movies use a lot of swear words 
 but are told at the end that they are college students . somehow 
 but as a diabolical captive who manipulates her captors with speech --while tied to her bed . proud 
 but as a live-action film 
 but as conspirators rather than potential lovers . the emotions of the film get confused and lost 
 but as i searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there to find . lee touches on so much -- the media 
 but as many of the relationships and situations presented themselves in this movie 
 but as much as i like a nice cheezy movie as much as the next guy 
 but as the film progressed she got better . although not one of her better turns 
 but as the producers' way of showing off their budget through the special effects . battle scenes are worthless without tension 
 but at filmcritic . com it gets a d- . 
 but at least he and farley worked well together . as far as the supporting players go 
 but at least he appears to have had fun doing it 
 but at least he wasn't overacting . i haven't read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based 
 but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff . here 
 but at least it didn't have me glancing at my watch every minute or so like it's sequel did . there are just so many problems with this movie that it's hard trying to figure out where to start . first of all 
" but at least it shows signs of a pulse . at least fans of the early-'90s tgif television line-up will be thrilled to find jaleel "" urkel "" white and bronson "" balki "" pinchot sharing the same footage . a few scenes are nicely realized ( though i'm at a loss to recall enough to be specific ) "
 but at least it's better than this . 
" but at least that movie more or less knew it was garbage . "" the astronaut's wife "" is grave and humor-free "
" but at least that piece of tripe was so bad i could laugh at it . "" the cell "" is one of the most pretentious "
 but at least twice i felt that she looked like lauren bacall 
 but at least you'll avoid the hate mail from the movie's fans . thus it is with a heavy heart that i review the movie paulina ( not to be confused with the recent movie paulie about a talking parrot ) . directed by vicky funari as a labor of intense love - she spent the last one third of her life on film - the movie blends documentary footage with historic and fanciful recreations to relate the bitterly sad and true story of paulina cruz suarez . paulina was a maid in vicky's household when vicky was young . i got to learn the film's background when i attended a screening in which the two women who made it were present . for those without such context 
 but at no time does it evoke the slightest amount of wonderment the genre was meant for . audiences' attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend with such films 
 but at times he doesn't know what kind of film he wants to make 
" but at times it comes disturbingly close . whereas movies like "" american pie "" are up-front about their attitude toward sex and profanity "
 but at what a price . please visit chad'z movie page @ http : //members . aol . com/chadpolenz 
 but awakens in her coffin in the graveyard the next day and is rescued by a crusty old journalist ( christopher george ) . that scene in itself is a howler : why would you bust open a coffin with a large pick axe when you know someone is alive inside ? and don't cadavers have various things stuffed in them and drained out of them before they're buried ? anyway 
" but bad in its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious "" lets explain the plot "" type approach . mccoll doesn't have a clue who her character is : deadly serious one minute "
 but basically trashes it with a formulaic and unoriginal plot that involves crooked cops and illicit drug deals . this '90's version also loses the rebellious anti-establishment undercurrents that were prevalent in the '60's and '70's 
 but basically what we have are good performers stuck in a bad vehicle . ( 3 ) the movie demeans women by depicting them solely as sexual objects and as pawns in power struggles between men . murphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary of women in his private life 
 but became a rather effective film . in this case you have a strong story with many possibilities and the result is a silly film . though several scenes bare the mark of professionalism ( such as the impressive battle scenes ) 
 but because he could make the movie rapidly and efficiently . it shows in the final product . cohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer 
 but because he induces a lot of passion in his role . contrary to him 
 but because it illustrates the film's complete disregard for the characters and the audience . it was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene 
 but because it is that 
 but because it's more suspenseful that way . taken as a whole 
 but because they have actually seen them . the adults don't develop faith until the girls take two photographs of fairies 
 but because they really 
 but because thurman's performance is the richest of the three . she plays it nave 
 but becomes awfully annoying when monkey bone takes over his body . bridget fonda is dreary and seems to bring the film to a screeching halt 
 but becomes more commonplace than sleeping in the picture . syd 
 but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan 
 but believe me 
 but bird-brained story of an evil spirit taking over gillian's body . whatever . the characters are handled terribly 
" but brain-dead slop is another matter altogether . tango & cash has "" lowest common denominator "" written all over it . the movie stars sylvester stallone and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in l . a . russell plays cash "
 but breillat saves her nastiest poison for the very end . on the long ride home punctuated by an uncomfortable silence between family members 
 but by and large city of the living dead is a failure . and like most cinematic failures 
 but by the time the real plot starts 
 but by then it's too late . mostow directs the action sequences well enough 
 but by this point 
 but by this point he's simply treading water for the rest of the film's unfunny duration . senseless would not be as problematic as it is if it didn't strive to be anything more than a comic trifle . however 
" but certainly don't see it unless you're in desperate need of a bad movie-induced chuckle -- "" hush "" scores so many unintentional guffaws that it almost qualifies as a guilty pleasure . chalk its losses up to frequent stupidity lapses and apparent post-production tinkering ( it was supposed to open about a year ago ) "
" but charlie desperately tries to prevent his melting demise . "" frosty the snowman "
 but checking your time piece to try to determine when it will all end . ghosts of mars is a snoozer . only the explosions may interfere with your napping . bob bloom is the film critic at the journal and courier in lafayette 
 but come on 
 but come on . like we care about any of the characters . the only interesting one is alicia 
 but come on . the worst flaw of the film is this : it's boring . i mean 
 but come on people 
 but come up with only pyrite . the only good that may come from this entire folly is to give lorne michaels second thoughts about mounting any features based on some of kattan's snl characters . corky romano is for the dogs 
 but comes up completely snake-eyes . it's just a pretend film noir 
 but condor finds the granddaughter by looking her up in the phone book or something . although these two women are supposed to be integral parts of the mission 
 but continue to make a load of money . which really goes to show the sad state of cinema today . while good comedies like rushmore 
 but conventionality may have made this an interesting character study . there are certain filmmakers who can turn narcissism into a fine art 
 but d . c . cab more or less falls flat on a continual basis 
 but de mornay executive produced it . what was she thinking ? never talk to strangers centers upon sarah 
 but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its 30-second tv spots . television is what's wrong with deep impact . the main character 
 but definitely not like chasing amy 
 but degenerates into camp farce with the arrival of the legless loveless and his amazon army . branagh's performance is all corn-ball humour and dreary accent and bad jokes 
" but dela is ultimately undone when to his surprise not only does the "" nigga "" -spouting dunwitty love the concept "
 but delving deeply into ian holm's character and his own personal demons 
 but desperately in want of a child . sam ( laurie ) and lucy ( joely richardson ) make love morning and night 
 but devices present only to serve the story . this would have been bad enough without the west's need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct . compelling films about sexual crimes don't spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks 
 but director mario van peebles undermines his own high points with haphazard camera work 
 but discounted any fall from grace 
 but dishonest 
 but do expect to be entertained by his moves . they are so well choreographed and often so amazing that you wonder if this guy is human . knowing that he does his own stunts 
 but does anyone care ? of course 
" but does it in such an over dramatized way that you'll start laughing . in fact the acting in "" showgirls "" brings terrible to a new and previously unknown level . not one single achievement "
 but does it very well . in doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen . he is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov's performance in spartacus . as an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself . danny elfman's score has a nice primitive feel 
 but does little to exploit it . the movie has no bite 
 but does not have any idea what to do with it as it progressively becomes more and more repetitive until i finally stopped enjoying or caring about what was happening on the screen . middle-aged psychoanalyst ben sobel's ( billy crystal ) life is finally going very well . although he has never gotten along with his own uncaring parents 
 but does not want to get married either . mans on the other hand has been having a problem of sexual impotence . the two friends worry about their problems and discuss the problems with each other . mans thinks the answer to his problem is to purchase sexual enhancers . the one catch is that he is too shy to go in and buy them . roro and yasmin decide to give themselves some time by telling the families that they want to marry each other 
 but doesn't add anything special to the role . chloe sevigny gives a terrible performance 
 but doesn't comfortably fit in his film 
 but doesn't do much . johnny cage 
 but doesn't know a toe from a finger 
 but doesn't really provide a lot of insight into this sleepy little town 
 but doesn't spend nearly enough time with them . when he receives a call from a music label that wants to hear him play 
 but doesn't succeed . somehow 
 but don't appear to be in this film . i already mentioned gina gershon ( who's pretty horrible in this one ) 
" but don't bother buying the soundtrack . i hear it' s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie . you want to see this concept executed well ? go rent roger corman's 1979 classic "" rock n' roll high school . "" it features another late-seventies rock band ( the ramones ) and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to their show . yes "
 but don't expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage . like broderick's 
 but don't seem any wiser . fresh from their first year of college the quartet 
 but due to the simple fact that the first round of sales in inexplicable 
 but each becomes totally irrelevant as the story changes from scenario to scenario . the atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel and various time paradoxes 
" but each has a problem . roro ( nicknamed "" jalla "" ) is having family problems . it seems that his family wants to arrange a marriage between him and a nice lebanese woman "
 but each tile is some woman's real experience . neither the picture of women 
 but eat away at them 
 but elements like these cannot go unnoticed because they draw our attention away from the story and confuse us . there was potential here for a good pirate story set in medieval times before modern technology 
 but elizabeth perkins' and steve buscemi's great talents are wasted on unnoticeable and shallow characters . although intellectually 'girl 
 but empty film to leave your memory . get your private 
 but encouraged . 
 but ends up just being extraneous because it's never followed through . for example 
 but ends up leaving a weird taste in your mouth . so if you want to watch a sort of odd movie starring the excellent dennis hopper 
 but ends up simply hard to watch . when watching the spice girls 
 but evans can't even aspire to that . the dogs upstage them both 
 but even he has to be thinking there's more to life than an easy paycheck . he's given plenty of wiseacre asides to deliver 
 but even her most devoted fans should consider giving this one a miss . and if your primary objective is catching a glimpse of her in the buff 
" but even here "" mercury rising "" doesn't rise to the challenge . the movie was directed by harold becker "
 but even that oh-so-cute non-romance we read about at checkout lines daily can't salvage this wreck . 
 but even the best ingredients can be thrown together in the wrong way 
 but even the most avid action fan is likely to be turned off by the movie's lethargic pacing . compared to the film's two hour running time 
 but even the most exciting scenes ( such as the one where art and simon are crouched down 
 but even then 
 but even they deserve better than this . for adults 
 but even this is missing from this stilted affair . wild wild west could have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked out style of directing 
 but even though he's of the lower classes 
 but eventually 
" but eventually it becomes disorienting . i would recommend that those who felt seasick at "" the blair witch project "" stay far away from "" detroit rock city "
 but eventually meet up the lone surviving astronaut-gone-rasta and solve the mysteries of the universe . and it's all so boring . there are so many scenes that just don't work 
 but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet 
 but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register . the film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience 
 but every time freeman goes on tv 
 but everybody talks . and the language they talk is earth- english . apparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that . the fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn't occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film . both just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english . in any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships . outside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic . leo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari 
 but everyone 
 but everyone else is painfully fake 
 but everyone is so awfully jolly that you'd hardly know it . mind you 
 but everything stultifies us with boredom 
 but excited about its release on dvd ! they have released two separate editions of the film on dvd 
 but executed it terribly . so what are the problems with the movie ? well 
 but extra pep is added with appearances by wrestlers goldberg 
 but fails miserably 
 but falls into so many problems 
 but fans of the film won't care . one question though . . . shouldn't the director's commentary be on the director's cut of the film ? i'd never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd . i was nine when it was released to theaters 
 but fellow wrestlers acknowledge this in the ring by calling him `fatty' 
 but few are noteworthy . the film definitely does suffer from its proximity to titanic . deep rising's peril in the water scenes pale next to cameron's ( but can you really blame them ) . unfortunately 
 but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation . brian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off . when he gets his hands on an intelligent 
 but finally end up liking each other once they both get a chance to save the other one's life . what happens after that is kind of a mystery to me . i'm fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons 
 but first 
 but first he has some community service to do 
 but for 1 
 but for a reason which is not totally explained 
 but for all the rest of us 
 but for different reasons than his superiors ( including the crusty brian cox ) -- they want to take mccabe down 
 but for iwo jima 
 but for most of the duration she's holed up in a glass cell . by the time the big breakout so prominently featured in the trailer actually takes place 
 but for one small flaw : she's engaged to be married to a slick junk bond king 
 but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time . big deal 
 but for some reason it didn't annoy me that much . chester's fiancee bess ( graff ) thinks he got a promotion in addition to the coaching position 
 but for the entire production itself . review by akiva gottlieb 
 but for what reason ? martha is only seen on the soccer field 
 but forgettable dialog . i refer you to the first paragraph of this review . 
 but funny because we know it is unbelievable . by explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible 
 but generally she just mopes around looking like a victim . her fellow students delight in tormenting her . of course 
 but gets even more farfetched 
 but given the increasing rash of real-life school killings 
 but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons . gellar 
 but goes no further . this movie needed more action in the first place . the action scenes that are here are short and not very exciting . if you like light-hearted action flicks 
 but going on would just be a waste of good words . only for die-hard creature feature fans 
 but goldsman doesn't seem to understand the rules that come with using such a story device ; when one character's past self dies 
" but good-hearted protagonist ; a rough and meanspirited coach ; and the "" big game . "" by the end "
 but good-heartedfrom 1999 . it is another one of those small-town sports movies that involves a flawed 
 but got nothing 
 but hardly anything else . for sandra bullock it's an opportunity to demonstrate that she is capable of more than 'speed' . she handles her part with a surprising professionalism and ease that certainly saves the film from being a complete flop . dominic west shines as the source of gwenie's devilish temptations 
" but hartman leaves him in the dust . [this appeared in the 4/4/96 "" bloomington voice "" "
 but has never been given a good role in her life 
 but has not yet made stardom . as the ape-trader limbo he over-emotes to overcome his ape make-up 
 but has some good moments ) . directed by martin lawrence 
 but he actively tries to put it behind him . he wants his son to take the game more seriously 
 but he breaks down and confesses to this the second he's accused . later 
 but he could still use a little polish . the worst case is lauren holly 
 but he couldn't find any sitting in a demolished fort knox ? not ludicrous enough for you ? try this one on for size : tyler and his troops just happen to find a fleet of harriers sitting armed 
 but he didn't believe the way marie's speech impediment was acted . 
 but he does not have the presence or weight to bolster a feature-length venture . it is sad to see a great actor such as falk reduced to playing such a stereotypical character 
 but he eschews that here in favor of hitchcockian trickery . philip goes out on a date with the blind woman 
 but he gets his brains ripped out in the end by a zombie and we don't care . in fact we don't care for anyone in city of the living dead 
" but he has hardly any screen time . he does get one of the film's few truly funny scenes however . the remaining actors fall into the "" don't care who they are or what they've done "" category "
" but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of "" pseudo "" -clever lines of dialogue . daniel baldwin has some potential "
 but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout . his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences . cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes . we see one side of a person's faces . but the other side fades into the darkness 
 but he is already in love with lisa ( tuva novotny ) . yasmin likes roro 
 but he is clearly out of his depth . broderick plays john brown 
 but he is happy-go-lucky in the penultimate sequence ( and can still walk ! ) 
 but he is of course charging the highest possible price for them : your soul . there are other developments 
 but he is stale and flat at times . steve zahn is perfect in the role of wayne lefessier 
 but he is still my favorite hack writer . koontz has a writing style which is succinct and suspenseful . people who read many of his books 
 but he just can't act very well . quinlan 
 but he lacks the flair and visual style of original creators roland emmerich and dean devlin . universal soldier the return lacks the energy and spectacularly staged action sequences of the original . this highly unlikely scenario uses the original provocative theme purely as an excuse for lots of testosterone-fuelled action 
 but he lucked out with this latest film . what could have been a courageous 
 but he may have saved this film from being the dreary 
 but he occasionally struggles with the uninteresting material . cast largely against type 
 but he overplays the role entirely too far . when all is said and done 
" but he overspouts platitudes and cliche "" morality . "" the goldblum-preston couple --who "
 but he paints his films with suspense 
 but he refuses to make such a commitment . ho-hum . another complication 
 but he sleepwalks his way through the role . i heard him in a recent interview discussing the types of roles he now takes 
 but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a less-than-ideal spokesman for any ideology . then again 
 but he wants his community to just get over it . reynolds could have been good 
 but he was yanked from the director's chair after only a week's worth of shooting because he was already $100 
 but he will also amuse you and instruct you . the film's mixed-genre is something that unsettles habitues of commercial spectacles . although our desire to classify what we see makes us wonder where exactly this movie fits ( from scene to scene--and within scenes --it swings from farce to drama and from comedy to tragedy ) 
 but he will not even kiss them . he's a man who knows his mind 
" but he's actually the * veteran * among this quartet of fine-looking people . sometimes a terrific cast like this can compensate for a lackluster screen treatment of an idea that has "" hip comedy "" written all over it "
" but he's also wrong . the new alien first appears as an otherworldly oozing sludge that causes patrick's pupils to dilate once he's infected . looks and sounds an awful lot like the x-files's "" black cancer "" to me . but that's not the only source director peter medak and writer chris brancato steal from . species was already a ripoff of alien "
 but he's as lost as we are . and thurman 
 but he's charming in that bad way 
 but he's horribly miscast ) is teamed up with effects specialist artemus gordon ( kline 
" but he's left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in "" all of me . "" it's a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting "
 but he's still fun to watch . i also liked the subplot involving danny's father ; brian cox's performance is powerful 
 but he's the producer so sooner or later he will have to agree . as the film ( and a restraining order from a woman who didn't want to be filmed ) go by elie wants more nudity and more sex in the film and refuses to fund it unless tia carrere is in the picture . this troubles myles because he's just met 
 but heffron has none . he shot the movie quickly and clumsily 
 but heffron's background in television is the dominant tone ; despite the graphic violence and full-frontal nudity 
 but her character isn't the moral staple she's supposed to be : sure 
" but her incessant wisecracking is poorly-written and merely stupid . her reaction to the brutal killing of a jogger is "" at least she died healthy . "" and that's one of her wittier asides . degeneres' sgt . rita pompano is called in to investigate the allegedly accidental death of . . . wait . to give away too much of the plot would all but ruin a film that has very little going for it outside of its numbing plot twists and multiple triple-crosses . it's best described this way : sultry sexpot/real estate agent sandra dunmore ( patricia arquette ) is married to jake "
 but her little sex comedy isn't very humerous 
 but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom . mysterty 
 but her role is somewhat 
 but here he is again with one of the main 
 but here he is too straight and serious . this is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time 
" but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt "" written "
 but here it is lost . miko hughes 
 but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor . add to that a lack of experience in big-budget action 
 but here it only serves to further highlight the film's flimsy script and plodding direction . the dialogue 
 but here's a behemoth running through the city ! there's bound to be a lot of casualties 
 but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there 
 but hey 
 but his approach isn't that of a typical cuckolded husband . instead of yelling or threatening 
 but his buddies say he would have gotten more if he had had sex with her after her death . ) even a helpless puppy is run over 
 but his bumbling assistants will make every adult cringe with disgust . the characters from the cartoon have been reduced to thankless supporting roles . penny ( michelle trachtenberg ) and brain the dog now have little to do with the action 
" but his character comes off as being very dense . and sheryl lee ( faring much better as laura palmer in "" twin peaks "" ) "
 but his contributions do raise the film's rating from no stars to one-and-a-half . thumbs up to fichtner then 
 but his few minutes of glory do not last long 
 but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life 
 but his harry isn't a person ; he's a walking plot device spouting occasionally-witty dialogue . dustin hoffman isn't lively or particularly good -- it's ironic that this 
 but his kidnapped daughter 
 but his latest film 
" but his new movie "" the art of war "" should just be called "" rising sun 2 : the art of war "" cause basically it's a semi-remake of the same plot "
" but his new vehicle "" money talks "" just doesn't do him service . tucker is good in the movie -- and this is the kind of film that "
 but his own . the other characters played by such wonderful actors as jack warden 
" but his passion is his schemes . every episode involves the sergeant and his men in one or another hair-brained plan to get rich quick while outwitting the officers of the base . "" mchale's navy "" 's granddaddy . that's the idea behind this movie too "
 but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace . the film's real star is young miko hughes ( heather langenkamp's son in wes craven's new nightmare ) 
 but his performance lends a contemporary flavour to the character . kline actually plays a dual role here 
 but his performance mainly consists of facial expressions : puppy dog love 
 but his role is the weakest and most clownish in the film . malkovich is miscast as he was in the 1988 period piece 'dangerous liaisons' and why an englishman 
 but his role isn't meaty enough to show all his talent . which leaves douglas to waltz away with the film 
 but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion . there is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman ( played by peter stormare ) that is so ineptly directed 
 but his track record with the movies is spotty . every now and then 
 but his wife did not . a few years later 
 but his woman too . what's worse is that sara actually seems interested in him ! wilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield 
 but hold on to your brooms and incantations 
 but hopkins even manages to botch that . for a big-budget film 
 but how about the fiftieth time ? unfortunately 
 but how can anyone recite insulting 
 but i always had the nagging thought that what director ramis and writers peter tolan 
 but i am really looking forward to the new exorcist film 
 but i believe that it is the title to his first movie 
 but i can't . what i can say of intersection is that it was almost a complete waste of my time . anything else i could say would be a waste of yours . 
 but i can't deny it's zany 
" but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultra-serious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv . even though "" dragnet "" is out of circulation at the moment "
 but i could be wrong . torgo also states 
 but i couldnt figure out what they were . all i saw was a very bizarre social satire that was woven with strange film techniques 
 but i didn't . i just didn't . surely this film isn't trying to win any major awards 
 but i digress ) which offers a couple of witty quips to keep you awake 
 but i don't blame her for not wanting to waste her time with this movie's disappointing and often lifeless screenplay 
 but i don't have room to mention it all in one review . in case you're wondering just who roger christian is 
" but i expected something . a funny joke . a clever prank . a plot development . anything . the movie never delivers . you've got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing . "" detroit rock city "" is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film's existence "
 but i failed to see even one redeeming virtue in him . consequently 
" but i guess "" the suits "" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge "
 but i had a few morality problems with it ( and i apologize for being vague ) . it's icky . it drips with gooey 
 but i hasten to add that i was rarely ever entertained . throughout 
 but i have finally figured out what made me sit through it . i ended up feeling sorry not for any character in the film 
 but i have to admit that i did love his neckties . they are simply spectacular--almost worth the price of admission . 
 but i have to wonder whether skin deep is a remake . you see 
" but i just can't figure one out . there's a regular husband-guy ( "" mr . rogers on acid "" as per the arrow's comments ) who lives a double as a pedophile . hmmmm . . . . yes "
 but i just didn't like the characters or the writing as much as i did in the first one . even though the movie doesn't have williamson 
" but i liked it a lot better over 30 years ago when it was called "" 2001 "" . i enjoyed it even more when it was titled "" close encounters "" . nasa has set its sights for mars . when the first crew meets with disaster "
" but i looked hard at the mod squad and couldn't find one . those of you who watched the 60's tv series on which this film is based know that the "" mod squad "" is a group of three young criminals ( claire danes "
 but i noticed it is badly filmed 
" but i personally did not notice her . she is well known for her number one single "" stay ( i missed you ) "" and goofy glasses . the creaks and moans heard throughout the house were prerecorded and played during filming in order to get a more natural expression of fear out of the actors . catherine zeta-jones is currently dating flabby ass actor michael "" sex is my life "" douglas . she stands 5'8 "" . in 1998 "
" but i seem to be getting this diversion to disney-made real-life actors movies . . . as well as real-life acting tim allen movies . i couldn't even make it through "" the santa clause "
 but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this . o'donnell plays jimmie shannon 
 but i still say jerry lewis is a notch or two up on the comedic ladder because he never actually did an impression in a movie of a rabid bulldog biting off a man's testicles . . . lewis at least had the dignity to save that performance for when company came over . 
 but i still think it's a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise . supergirl 
 but i suppose that ricci's hospital room scene might be worth a look for some of you horn-dogs . the worst part about this movie is its hilariously unbelievable ending 
 but i suppose they all are guilty to some degree . scene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity ; minutes after finding the dead young woman 
 but i think his words can be accurately applied to tarsem singh's travesty 
" but i think most american parents would agree that early childhood is a time of mental innocence that should be protected from uncaring media market exploitation . to many american mothers there's probably nothing more pathetic and unsettling than the sight of a theater full of unsupervised little eight year olds laughing raucously as movie character father adam sandler jokes about a woman's "" ice cold tits . "" "
" but i thought it was a bit creepy . the message seemed to be "" ignore your responsibilities unrepentantly and have fun fucking who you wish . "" "" family values "" aside "
 but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines 
 but i truly believe it must be witnessed to be fully appreciated . most bad films have at least one redeeming quality to them ; whether it be unintentional laughs 
 but i was not so lucky . hopefully 
 but i was out of luck . now 
 but i was personally never able to involve myself too much 
 but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc . as the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence 
 but i welcome the change because henstridge is an attractive 
 but i will admit that species 2 is dopey enough that it didn't try my patience to the degree that some pseudo-intellectual bad movies do . here's hoping there's no species 3 . 
 but i'd talke her any day ove the dreadfully stiff and uncharismatic witt 
 but i'll bet more than a few dollars that the story was better in book form . the movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space 
 but i'll go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis . the film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship . in addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics 
 but i'll issue a warning anyhow . tommy is really working with the cia . his boss ( a very hammy and flat paul sorvino ) is the mole 
 but i'll say it : * if you can park virtually every expectation at the door * 
 but i'll sum by saying angel cop is a good way not to introduce someone to anime . 
 but i'll try . let's see . among the ridiculous scenes : a moment where dunn confronts the woman with the tape 
 but i'm going to anyway . first of all 
 but i'm not among them . i sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie ( i no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham ) 
 but i'm not quite sure how . the supernatural parts of the film are actually interesting 
 but i'm not so sure if some of the more hilarious things about it were meant to be so . the filmmakers don't get much help from their onscreen talent . i was far from a fan of bland _i_know . . . _ starlet jennifer love hewitt 
 but i'm sure even young teens would make it through this movie okay . instead of watching this film 
" but i've wasted enough time writing about this stupid movie . i'd recommend "" battlefield earth "" to aspiring directors so they can see how not to make a sci-fi movie "
 but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker . today audiences have higher expectations ; baker's visualization is really an improvement . these visuals work nicely . what does not work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make . they look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger 
 but if i were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is `mission to mars' 
 but if i were to tell you 
 but if that's the case it failed miserably . devito plays the only fully likeable character here - the sheriff with a heart of gold . the truth is 
 but if they didn't look out because you are in for a rather interesting if not odd ride . heck depending on your humor you might end up laughing through the whole flick . either way look out america bean is coming . well 
 but if you do go 
 but if you don't figure it out you must have been asleep ( not that i can blame you for that . wish i'd fallen asleep ) . third 
 but if you have seen any horror movies whatsoever 
 but imamura makes his point : kametaro ( and the audience ) are well on their way to realizing that the story of toriko has now become intimately anchored within the village's traditions and collective mythology -- just as a large rock hurled onto the island became a part of the local lore twenty years earlier . imamura is in this film concerned with the symbiotic relationship among individual humans in a primitive society 
 but in a much more entertaining fashion . skip this dull film 
 but in any terms 
 but in case you never attended junior high and think the cuban missile crisis was a bad porno 
 but in either case 
 but in fact the third installment ( it was the first to gain a national theatrical release ) . i didn't see the first film until much later . so looking back 
 but in order to prove it 
 but in reality probably 80% of americans are neither atheists nor far-right fundamentalists . palmer joss occupies something of a middle ground 
 but in the case of evans 
 but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer . 
 but in these last two years 
 but in this film he's weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way . hank azaria does what he can 
 but in this one the reaction is likely to be decidedly muted . high art runs 1 : 36 . it is rated r for explicit sex 
 but innocent-at-heart sil was too sympathetic ; no such problem with patrick 
 but instead director scott silver puts shackles on her and simply does not allow her to do anything really significant with her role . epps and ribisi fare slightly better and do as well as can be expected 
 but instead filler that starts out with potential 
 but instead godzilla is afflicted with the after-school g . i . joe cartoon syndrome 
 but instead the real subject is the bad conscience of the oppressors . so 
 but intellectually hollow . the love story between han ( jet li ) and trish ( aalyah ) 
 but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn't engage . at first you do not know what's going on . is this part of the experiment ? are these hallucinations ? projections of the subconscience ? paranoia ? but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening . the house is actually possessed . it is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window . for ever 
 but interesting ? not in this movie . you know where the film's heading when it manages to poke fun at asians 
 but is about 50 years younger . mercury rising joins the likes of hard rain 
 but is all but forgotten about thereafter . it's obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber 
 but is all in a day's work for him . he combs the newspaper 
 but is captured ( as a slave ) by a circus leader who runs a traveling gladiator show . coincidentally 
 but is conveniently able to leap atop others ? why do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him 
 but is hardly involved in any concern for others . it takes a while for us to sort things out in those concentric circles 
 but is it the same person or are there multiple criminals ? adam beach unfortunately was the wrong choice for the lead in this film . he doesn't play the role with enough seriousness to be believable or enough goofiness for it to be funny . his performance is stuck somewhere in the middle 
 but is no where near as amusing as johnny cage was . williams just tries too hard to be will smith . he seems to have some talent buried in him that briefly shines through here and there 
 but is not horrible . and we even get a small performance from that god of drill sergeants on celluloid 
" but is occasionally embarrassing to watch . only some lively performances save this from the scrap heap of the truly dreadful . "" bring it on "" ? do us all a favour -- please "
 but is out of the picture just as we are beginning to know her . and singer sinead o'connor appears rather effectively as the virgin mary who occasionally gives francis advice . the pacing is all off in 
 but is overdone 
 but is powerless to do anything about it . she merely struggles on 
" but is probably one of the worst movies of all time . "" detroit rock city "" doesn't quite reach that level of ineptitude "
 but is really just hoping to get a scholarship at brown university so that he can get out of the dead-end town . at least he's got the right idea 
 but is surprisingly bereft of humor . there are noticeable attempts at laughs 
 but is the journey to get to that ending worth it ? no 
 but is then killed off halfway through . the director 
 but is this intended as a sad or happy ending 
 but is too muddled in its own cliches and predictability to be the least bit touching . this does not come as a surprise 
 but it almost makes this tired alien clone bearable . as far as the monster goes 
 but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters . of its motley crew 
" but it also looks so familiar . a race of large hulking ape-like creatures has taken over the world while our cities lie in ruin . sound like something charlton heston might be in ? the psychlo look like overweight klingons in gear from "" dune "" . the final air battle between the air force fighters and the psychlo ships in their high-tech city is something george lucas might have been associated with . it's too loud . it's too oppressive . it's too slow . it's too long . . . far too long . and on it goes . the list of the problems with "" battlefield earth "" is endless . it's difficult to find anything in the film that does work . "
 but it also points up how all the other storylines ( the publisher 
 but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny twin continued . either that 
" but it can't buy you backbone . take dead aim at the rich kids ! "" i don't think i ever truly appreciated that slice of wisdom until ellis got in my face . hey bret : here's a quarter . go call someone who cares . and pass the amphetamines . fast . you're losing me . "
 but it certainly doesn't make this film a powerhouse thriller 
 but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a two-hour film 
 but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous 
 but it does borrow heavily from frederick knott's play ( which was also the source material for hitchcock's version 
 but it does effectively address how these concerns have changed the community five years after the main events of the film . kariya 
 but it does ensure that universal soldier : the return gains a brief cinema release before disappearing into the same video wilderness that has claimed most of his recent lacklustre efforts . with the end of the cold war 
 but it does not wash up to the original . kids should find this movie amusing and fun and they'll probably enjoy the whole movie . as a movie it's just a kids movie and not the best of ones at that . 
 but it doesn't always translate to the screen . christian bale's mannered performance as psycho's killer patrick bateman was appropriately deadpan . would that declan thurman ( uma's brother ) showed such restraint filling the same role in exit . he blows line readings with a distracting assortment of eyebrow and lip twitches . see 
 but it doesn't benefit from chan's incredible stunts and goofy 
 but it doesn't bother to give any of the on-screen individuals even a hint of depth . the men and women populating the picture are there to look nice 
 but it doesn't do much for me . on the surface 
 but it doesn't have much to do with the main story . one of the problems 
 but it doesn't help that he has no character to work with . kumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character 
 but it doesn't make a shred of sense . and whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film ? james foley knows a lot about characters and acting 
 but it ended up being a set-up for nothing . cale chokes on a deadly wasp ( don't ask me how that happens - i don't know ) and is put out of action 
 but it ends up failing on both fronts . maybe the book was better 
 but it ends up taking itself so seriously that there's no way we can join it . cruel intentions also manages to come off as soft-porn in more than one scene . earlier i mentioned a fully-clothed hand-job ; this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont 
 but it falls very short . it's a dissatisfying spectacle 
 but it feels like four hours ) . also 
 but it feels the need to go off on tangents that are completely unnecessary ( and bad at that ) . there's just too much of a sit-com feel here 
 but it gets dangerously close . in fact 
 but it has advanced surprisingly little . apparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control . and from carpenter's view 
 but it is also disarmingly laidback and easygoing enough that that neither the narrative impact nor the cinematic illusion ( except during the epilogue ) is ever lost . kamigami no fukaki yokubo is another of imamura's excellent films 
 but it is an idea that is well executed and in the end makes the poor robot the most developed and real character in the movie . yes folks the little yellow robot has more emotion and character than the characters . the film lacks the emotional punch to pull the audience in at all . the acting by robin williams ( prof . brainard ) seems to be half hearted for most of the movie and in many cases quite forced . most of the acting in the movie was so convincing as to fool only the part of the audience that had not quite yet reached the age to 12 . people when stood up at the altar 
 but it is borderline offensive . offensive in the way it continues a trend of poking fun at career criminals who wouldn't think twice about pushing your mother-in-law off the brooklyn bridge with her feet encased in concrete . that might sound like a funny sight gag 
 but it is buried under heaps of cliches and her performance is too restrained . she could have been a tour-de-force 
 but it is essentially an original work . the french new wave--by now old but staging a welcome comeback via contemporary imitators in britain and elsewhere--may also come to mind 
 but it is fairly hard to say if he is good or not in the picture 
 but it is far from one of the best 
 but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to a brick wall half the time . a friendship develops between the two men 
 but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly low-powered alien menace . in addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars 
 but it is not planet of the apes . as with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century 
 but it is obvious from the first frame who it is 
 but it is the most boring . parents : do yourselves a favor and take your kids to see the rerelease of 
" but it is the movie-goers who pay the price by being dealt the same things over and over on an ever-worsening basis . "" lost in space "" is the latest such offering - a film so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre . it's made up of every element of science fiction "
" but it is the supporting characters who are the most interesting . patricia clarkson ( 1998's "" high art "
 but it is thoroughly violent 
 but it isn't exactly her fault . the director asks for little from his actors 
 but it isn't smart enough to realize it . even the mandatory epilogue is as pointless and predictable as the rest of the movie . the rage : carrie 2 runs 1 : 45 . it is rated r for graphic violence 
 but it isn't very convincing . also 
 but it isn't very interesting because they're not talking about anything relevant . marty meets a generic p . i . ( walsh ) who seems too bubbly and happy compared to marty's nearly psychotic attitude . the two characters clash like polkadots and plaid . this isn't anything moody or intense 
 but it just isn't unique . it is a classic example of a film that didn't need to be made . but one thing is for sure 
 but it just seems that someone should have reminded director randall wallace that the film is set in the 1660's and not the 1960's . peace . 
 but it just wasn't right . that little bit showed me that someone either didn't do the appropriate research 
 but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting . kathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch 
 but it leaves audiences with a booby prize . ( opens october 16 ) 
 but it makes about as much sense 
 but it never is in these movies . but what about the script ? well 
 but it never provides any insight into his work or any motivation for his attitude . when interviewed by a fawning talk show host 
" but it never seems that way . there's no "" world reaction "" to anything . the omega code is available on dvd from goodtimes home video . it contains the film in the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 "
 but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate . although only an hour and a half in length 
 but it only cheapens hammer's character and is 
 but it only gets worse after the opening scenes of arnold and mailman sinbad stampeding through a store 
 but it seems like it is well over it . there's just not enough humor to speed things along 
 but it seems that this cycle of horror movies 
 but it seems to have a life of its own . this is there strictly for the kids . the properties of the flubber provide some antics for the audience when flubber coated golfballs and bowling balls assail two would be thugs . although amusing this is not original what so ever and brings back haunting memories of home alone . the poor professor has to save the university where he teaches at 
 but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes . and do they make things entertaining 
 but it shows now 
 but it soon doesn't matter 
" but it still didn't the make the film all that more entertaining . i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is "" into it "" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding . i mean "
 but it succeeds only in being very dark . perhaps most terrifying of all is that the actors involved appeared to be having a grand old time acting like yugo driving demons ( everyone in the film drives a yugo ) . bette midler is amazingly convincing as the queen of this hell on earth 
 but it takes a lot of skill to make the formula work . rosenberg's script is a complete mess 
 but it takes an hour and a half before the film even starts trying to get the adrenalin pumping . the big problem with the movie is that it feels like it was made from the first draft of the script rather than the final version . rosenberg's storytelling is extremely clumsy . after a mildly entertaining opening bit 
 but it takes itself far too seriously to be truly fun . oh 
 but it takes one-hundred minutes to get across this transparent point . there are some worthwhile moments 
 but it takes some leap of the imagination to accept her as kate capshaw's mother here . ellen degeneres gets the bulk of the one liners as janet 
 but it turns to vinegar . it's annoying stupid 
 but it was * fun * . it was one of the most * fun * movies of the summer of 1995 . it had some funny dialouge 
 but it was far from the truth . while gibson's character certainly broke the law 
 but it was nominated for a lot of cesars ( french equivalent of oscars ) . the writing and directing is really the big problem with it . josiane balasko does a good acting job with her role 
 but it was quite the letdown nonetheless 
 but it was really so much better . even if you didn't catch all the new language or rituals originated by frank herbert ( for he is the kwizatz haderach ! ) 
 but it wasn't 
 but it wasn't and in the end might have done the movie more harm than good . now 
 but it would be overly familiar as a western . further respectability comes from ben kingsley's high-powered performance . i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to + 4 scale . 
 but it would have been more original than anything in sister's tiresome script . the film opens with carla ( juliette lewis 
 but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something . the test of a van damme movie boils down to the action sequences 
 but it'll do until something worse comes along . the film 
 but it's a cheap looking 
 but it's a good idea to let your audience know right from the beginning that your movie is actually about something . 3 ) keep it moving . long 
 but it's against the law . this is a movie made of pretty 
 but it's all in the setup . we're introduced to norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) 
 but it's almost always accompanied by the ripping open of a woman's abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free

 but possesses no physical excitement or wonder . ok 
 but presents it in a very bad package . which is what makes this review an even harder one to write 
 but pretty soon this has no effect on the audience 
 but provides the film's better moments . and what is the beautiful lela rochon doing in this movie ? hopefully she grabbed her paycheck and then fled the premises like an olympic sprinter . knock off doesn't even stand strong as a mindless but entertaining action film

 but says if he forgets the wedding again she'll stop loving him ( a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has ) . but even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve 
 but seems much longer . most of what comes on screen is generic sit-com level material -- the kind of slop that people will absorb while dozing off in their favorite easy chair in front of the television set . if there's any upside 
 but severely misguided film 
 but she actually puts on even more clothes as the film progresses . this will probably disappoint many henstridge fans 
 but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible . but i can't forget mr . phillippe 
 but she has a heart of gold ( don't they always in this type of movie ) and is only trying to protect the boy 
 but she just leaves a bad taste in your mouth . some of the supporting cast ( notably gina gershon and michael rapaport ) give stronger 
 but she outdid every adult in the film ( she's no doubt in a mental institute somewhere after experiencing this movie ) . john reynolds 
 but she was also intelligent and strong-willed . irene is nothing in particular 
 but she's also realizes she's still in love with alain chabat . so 
 but she's fighting an uphill battle and just can't make the movie succeed on her own . dushku is also very good 
 but she's kind of a hypocrite since she's carrying on an affair with a businessman rade serbedzija ) . her excuse for her affair is neglect from bolek

 but so what ? it's all deja vu . the only original 
 but some jaw-dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile . however 
 but some of his looks are worth a chuckle . richard gere has a couple of good moments 
 but some of its jokes were actually true ! the government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security 
 but some of the dialogue as well . unfortunate

 but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings 
 but somehow nothing works . francis is in almost every scene 
 but somehow the whole thing lacks credibility and a genuine sense of excitement . with this often silly mix of western action and high-tech gadgetry 
 but somehow you get the feeling that she didn't pass away under normal circumstances ! realizing that abby's rare blood type holds the key to his fountain-of-youth elixir 
 but something about it seemed . . . well 
 but sometimes an animated film comes along that is simply awful . as said before

 but soon everyone else in town has succumbed and it isn't long before the whole place is going up in flames . god 
" but spouts "" wisdom "" and true values that somehow ( don't ask ) send the sales skyrocketing . it's all silliness and inanity . how sad . at his best murphy can be wildly funny with his distinctive ebullience "
 but stacey's character is far too accommodating . not only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery 
 but stargher has fallen into a coma from which he will never awaken . this wouldn't be a problem except for the fact that he kidnapped one last girl who is in that very room 
 but stargher's mind is ready for him . stephen king once said 
 but stavros is out for revenge and kidnaps her . so

 but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver's travels and treat it as an action film . that makes it a film without much center . rating : 4 ( 0 to 10 )

 but the effect never quite comes together . it's got the sultry florida heat 
" but the end result is a film that basically plays out like an extended skit on "" saturday night live "" . there are a couple of funny one-liners "
 but the end result is much too artificial . a lot of the problems lie with the script

 but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners . with a little more maturity and different handling 
 but the fact that his wife 
 but the fact that the film's best joke is completely dependent on one's familiarity with another film says a lot about _roxbury_'s lack of inspiration . that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves . like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of _saturday_night_live_

 but the movie itself is leaden . the film takes itself all too seriously . at best 
 but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment ; its constant equation of sex and violence 
 but the movie segments that deal with the plight of apaches and the uprising are given too little time . instead 
 but the movie simply doesn't have the capacity to make us care ; it's too busy hustling us through one manufactured conflict after another . the details of the seal training are ridiculous and overblown . in richard marcienko's eye-opening book rogue warrior

 but the problem is that it's not outrageous at all or even the least bit interesting . hav plenty isn't so much a bad film as it is a total waste of the audience's time . hav plenty runs 1 : 32 . it is rated r for profanity and would be fine for most teenagers . 
 but the problem is these films have long since lost sight of the fact that taking a human life isn't all that funny to begin with . when the corpse is placed in a car 
 but the psychiatrist soon finds himself to be the one who’s being taught a lesson . there’s some message about how no human actually has control 
 but the punk landlords want him out 
 but the quantity . most of those movies were produced by cannon group 
 but the question comes down to why -- and 
 but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable . so 
 but the remaining girls' identities are a little harder to flesh out . there really isn't much to do with sporty besides having her exercise every so often ( which is _exactly_ what fuller and spiers do ) 
 but the result is a great disaster . starting in a near future 
 but the same thing seems to be happening again . this time 
 but the screenplay keeps providing them with unnecessary clarifications . my reviews have featured a lot of quotations as of late 
 but the script doesn't go anywhere with it 
 but the script would have to have been written in less than five minutes and by a five year old . the choppy dialogue and bad directing don't help things any . even though chris o'donnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movies 
 but the sets look nice 
 but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse . the film has no social message like its predecessors . the relationship between the friends 
 but the sleight-of-hand of script 
 but the story needs to make sense when it's over . the corruptor never manages to make any sense -- it just keeps spinning out of control until 
 but the story never takes off 
 but the story was thin 
" but the storyline and the finished product don't work as well . the sad thing is that "" end of days "" had so many things going for it . the plot could have been more organized "
 but the thing that bothered me is that plenty of that violence didn’t seem to be occurring for a reason . another depressing factor of the film was that everything was shot when it was really cloudy or with no light 
 but the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him . burt reynolds could have been interesting as walter

 but the way they get out of them are always unsatisfying 
" but the whole "" psychiatrist working against the clock "" thing "
 but the whole movie is weighed down directly on their shoulders with nothing else to support them 
 but the whole thing smells of paint-by-numbers . sure 
 but the wild wild west makes this joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness . there's also problems with the plot . jim west and artemus gordon get caught up in all kinds of sticky situations 
 but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship . the first half of the film is about the young man's plan to win her back . of course the thing is 
" but the words should at least partially convey what i'm talking about . . . "" now you listen to me "
 but the writing can be faulted for that . helgenberger and madsen go through the motions 
 but their adult companions may feel a wave of nausea sweeping over them as they attempt to endure this appalling 80-minute exercise in glaring stupidity . the movie is poorly edited 
 but their characters are so infuriating that . . . well trust me 
 but their characters are so one-dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking . scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat 
 but their expression seems to be more of a catharsis for the creator than us . the actors do a fine job 
 but their ultimate resolution will leave viewers wondering if they had missed something . and then there's some atrocious dialogue 
 but then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would have had difficulty acting the roles . having the cast that was present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe . watching these actors act this story out made it bearable 
 but then apologies 
 but then becoming annoying and brattish halfway through and finally turn 'all american' wholesome goodness at the end of the film 
 but then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies . the thin supporting cast includes david suchet 
 but then i realized this is just not so . i still adore almost all of the older disney films 
 but then it's back to the shouting and swearing 
 but then no storm is perfect . ) he quickly finds 
 but then plan to break up before the wedding . not too surprisingly neither finds that his idea works out the way he quite expected . the plot turns in several places are contrived . one knows fairly quickly that if things are going to work our happily for everybody certain plot contrivances have to happen . lebanese-born josef fares who wrote and directed is perhaps a better director than he is a writer . when things start to get slow 
 but then she always miraculously disappears when the next film is made two or three years later . although donna murphy 
 but then there are all of those dead spots in-between . paulie is a movie that never quite lives up to its promise but manages to charm nevertheless . paulie runs 1 : 32 . it is raged pg for a few mild profanities and would be fine for all ages . my son 
 but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention . it is disappointing 
 but there are embarrassingly long stretches that are utterly devoid of humour . moore is totally wasted 
 but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films 
 but there are lots of martial arts in the film . ray is good at martial arts 
 but there are none to speak of in this sequel ( although they do come close at one moment with brandy ) . since so many people were killed every couple minutes 
 but there are still a number of problems with the narrative structure . despite its lengthy running time 
 but there is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth . i did everything i possibly could to stay awake during the screening . . . i cleaned my glasses 
 but there is an even more astonishing selection . for a director they tapped hong kong's stanley tong 
 but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool . in spite of the provocative title 
 but there is no real enthusiasm to the performance . cage lowers himself to the standards of the script 
 but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase and fight sequences written by desouza . there isn't anything as preposterously amusing as the climactic tiger/land mine fight in _double_team_ 
 but there is one that really stands out : its central plot device is unnecessary . that's right . the major aspect of the film 
 but there is only one problem -- jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary 
 but there isn't too much else happening here stylewise . . . unless you count some farting 
 but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring . you see 
 but there was scant evidence of it on tv . while young people were challenging traditional values on the streets 
 but there was something subtle in the film that begged me to like it even the slightest bit . i mean 
" but there you have it . there are two more things worth noting in "" manos "" . one is the dialogue "
 but there's a lot more that needs to be here . inspiration 
 but there's no particular reason why it should be built . why not loveless build a great big tank 
 but there's no purpose to anything in this film . most of the sex and violence scenes come off as silly 
 but there's no semblance here . for instance 
 but there's not a sympathetic one in the whole bunch 
 but there's nothing especially unique to be learned from each section . canadian producer/director ron mann uses a combination of old film and television footage and interviews with now middle-aged american bandstand dancers and recording artists . he spotlights these performers by having them jiggle in front of heavily stylized backgrounds and 
 but there's nothing going on inside . ( opens february 27 ) 
 but there's nothing truly funny . they show appropriately staged scenes of sadness 
 but there's only so much a child actress can do recounting pretentious monologues to herself . if one is inspired to rescue this young performer and place her in a better movie 
 but there's sad music 
" but there's some absurd dialogue and conceptual problems with the story . plus the movie's ending ( understandably the result of the studio wanting the end of the film to have a "" hook "" for a sequel ) renders the rest of the film pointless . and does anyone understand what happens to nancy's mother at the end of this film ? don't get me wrong though . . . it's not as if a new generation of horror films have spurned me away from the classics . most horror movies released today are just as inane as this film is . horror is a difficult genre to pull off credibly "
 but there's some hackneyed sub-plot about douglas being a ruthless player on wall street ( again ) and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched . the characters also make incredibly dumb moves 
 but these actors don't even look like they believe in the move they're making . they look a lot like they're bored . just like the audience . so what do you have when the humor is absent from your comedy 
 but these are usually strangely delivered wrong and lose most of the humour . the film 
 but these conversations barely register . and as for freeman 
 but these do not take off . 
 but these movies he makes are all the same : a guy who is basically indestructable 
" but these never cause your personal laugh-o-meter to rise above the level of mild bemusement . "" well "
" but they "" the meaner "" would have been a more appropriate title because he's cold "
 but they all lead to comic dead ends . there is no story per se 
 but they also confirm why these people are musicians and not actors . blues brothers 2000 is deserving of one whole star simply because if you really 
 but they are already hampered by the clichd development that somewhere between the two films 
 but they are far and few between . the last thing a thriller should be is boring 
 but they are few and far between . if i had to choose a favourite performance 
 but they are mistaken for new park rangers . the rest of the movie has them fighting the park's overpopulation of prairie dogs as well as a deranged ex-ranger 
 but they are no more than a light show to support a movie that really isn't about much of anything . i kept harkening back to the abyss 
 but they are not actors 
 but they are of little importance . all that matters to director kevin hooks and writers william mickelberry and dan vining are the obstacles jack confronts in his drive from point a to point b . but they fail at even this modest goal 
 but they are so flat and so plastic that they come off as prefabricated and unbelievable . there's never the sense that these are real characters engaging in conversation . they appear to be nothing more than words on a screenplay . the characters 
 but they are so lackluster and without suspense that we don't feel as if they are leading up to anything . for example 
 but they are sorely wasted here and do not really even have characters to play . in her second return to horror in the last year 
 but they certainly don't explore or challenge patch's ideas to any meaningful extent . reader 
 but they do extremely well with what they are given here . kudos to both of them . my advice to adam is to try and follow in the footsteps of veteran comedians like williams and steve martin 
 but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story . shelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions . play it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull 
 but they do not talk . they say things that only relate to the conflict 
 but they don't go anywhere either . in fact 
 but they don't have a single scene together before simmons' death ! ) 
 but they don't really try hard enough . maybe the mayor's abrasive mother-in-law should have been the one . for no apparent reason 
 but they essentially behave as human savages 
 but they give you nothing to be really sad about . as columnist molly ivins would say 
 but they have been unable to reverse his declining box office fortunes . in knock off 
 but they have had their share of screen successes since ; the same can't be said of swayze 
 but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder . of course 
 but they haven't the faintest idea how to make a movie . 
 but they just really didn't seem funny to me . and that car rolling off the cliff ? the only way i would've seen humor in that is if they were still in it . and the ending gets all super-mushy 
 but they lack that take-no-prisoners bite that raised scary movie to the heights of burlesque . scary movie 2 merely lurches from one lame sendup to another 
 but they like kiss and they like rock n' roll 
 but they manage to capture the same vein of nerve-addled humor that bill paxton delivered as hudson in aliens ( or todd graff as hippie in the abyss 
 but they must have all been on auto-pilot . one of the most disappointing and wasted opportunities in the film is the way the movie deals with the supporting characters 
 but they never really interact ( unless it's the cartoony flirting scenes between arrogant major don west ( leblanc ) and uptight 
 but they only serve as window dressing . there is a running gag about the town 
 but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos . my advice to fans is : stay home and watch that video collection 
 but they receive very little help . the film does have some nice photography . they sure got the look of a old-fashioned romance right . but the most important thing in any romance is chemistry 
 but they share similar facial features 
 but they should absorb you enough so that you're not thinking about the lack of realism . the only artistic aspect of tango & cash is the cinematography . there are some spectacular shots 
 but they still have a much longer way to go . almodovar 
 but they sure don't make em like they used to . 
 but they take on slightly different roles . for instance 
 but they use smart writing and clever direction to more than make up for it . they are no more than they need to be . the pagemaster badly wants to be an eyeful of the disney variety 
 but they're actually an ingenious invention thought up by john reynolds . torgo is actually supposed to be a satyr 
 but they're close . as i said 
 but they're fun action scenes amongst a crowd of laughably inane concepts . it's fun to admire the awfulness of a film like this 
 but they're just not enough to sustain the film . 
 but they're loud 
 but they're not here 
 but they're not interesting . ( it's possible to make a good movie with detestable characters -- see reservoir dogs -- but there has to be something compelling about them 
 but they're not new ; how many car chases through chinatown have you seen ? on that note 
 but they're still pretty good . unfortunately 
 but they're stuck in the most boring plotlines . modine whines and complains and would be completely pathetic if he was matched against someone stronger than elizabeth berkley 
 but things are looking up when a mysterious woman 
 but thinks it's the funniest thing since plan 9 ; 
" but this "" mod squad "" plods anyway . characters are non-existent ; present are just some good-looking young things modeling cool levis and cooler attitudes . plot hardly escapes confusing convention . and the one genre element you'd think would be show up in generous portions - a few nifty explosions "
 but this conflict of interest doesn't keep him from offering pursuit . lacrosse's most recent trek takes him to a blood-soaked hotel room in amarillo 
 but this dross just shows how far disney have sunk . christopher lloyd plays a martian who crash lands in front of t . v reporter's tim o'hara car ( daniels ) 
" but this film differs from those earlier versions in one major way : it includes all of the sex and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywood's production code . although this takes the 1982 version of "" i "
 but this has got to be one of the worst . a totally dull story that thinks it can use various explosions to make it interesting 
 but this has to be the first anime where i've seen a normal guy who looked like he had more scar tissue than healthy flesh . oh 
 but this is certainly not it . 
 but this is just a big mess . it looks like 1995's mortal kombat remains the only truly * good * video game-based film so far . the mistakes here are so obvious . this should've been better . 
" but this is just bad . none of the characters are more intelligent than peter stormare in "" fargo "" ( a movie where stupid characters were backed up to make a point ) "
" but this is no "" alfie . "" of coure "
 but this is no use for the other 99% of the paying audience who haven't been lost in the woods . apart from the final minutes 
 but this is the kind of role he can sleepwalk through 
 but this is the one that * intentionally * made me laugh . unlike american pictures 
 but this just seemed like laziness on the writers' part more than anything else . the successes of contact 
 but this movie easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer possible . once again 
 but this movie just doesn't gather any comedy or originality out of this age-old community of people . in regards to the actors 
 but this nutty nonsense really pushes the envelope . things start out strong enough 
" but this ode to excess and violent consumerism is one of the most shameful . never mind the subplot with perfect neighbor phil hartman trying to seduce wilson while arnold is off shopping ( "" your cookies are incredible "" ) "
 but this one has that message 
 but this one is shockingly timid . there are a few good scenes 
 but this particular experiment is not a success . tectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine ( marie gignac ) 
 but this time 
 but this time around 
 but this time detective 
 but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue . his investigation is soon called off 
 but this time he crashes and burns like the plush 747 o'hare red-eye that makes a fiery farewell . the performances are weak 
 but this time there are two pregnancies . george banks ( martin ) is a wealthy man approaching 50 contented with his life 
 but this time there's a twist . freeman notes that each of the young women who've disappeared are all strong willed 
 but this was more of a plus-side for the film as a whole than the opposite ) ; instead 
 but three separate enemy factions firing at franklin as they pursue him through the bleachers . the villains 
 but three times to review these discs . supergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package 
 but three writers 
 but through a misunderstanding 
 but through some turns of the plot 
 but throughout this very long movie 
 but tightly focused detective that almost transcends the material . the biggest waste of resources is vinnie jones 
 but to little avail . we know that blythe danner is gwyneth paltrow's mother 
 but to no one else . i give the film one and a half out of five stars . oh ! before i forget 
 but to no one else under any circumstances . the movie runs a torturous 117 minutes 
 but to the rest of the movie as well . in this 
 but to this day i'm still groaning . the bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video . it contains the film in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 
 but too bad to be good . unfortunately 
 but too dramatic to be good trash . the story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell ( james mason ) and his son 
 but too much screen-time is devoted to harry houdini ( harvey keitel ) and sir arthur conan doyle ( peter o'toole ) . because of the claimed truthfulness of the story 
 but too often favors the film's visual presentation over the story he's trying to tell . this bodes horribly for each dramatic development 
 but travolta just has a goatee . also 
" but trey callaway's derivative "" i still know "" screenplay makes the fisherman just as dumb as his pretty potential victims . when julie lays blissfully unaware in a tanning bed "
 but trust me 
 but turns into a typical action movie . that's pretty much it on plot . it does have the razzle and dazzle of a great action movie 
 but twenty minutes of stiller going berserk as a strung-out junkie are more than enough . sadly 
" but two pieces of wood would do . peter cushing does it all the time . "" a disquisition on vampires follows . "" we need a book "
 but unbelievable 
 but unfortunately 
 but unfortunately for me 
 but unfortunately for us 
 but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldn't be attributed to the cultural barrier either . keep cool just isn't very funny . the prelude to the film was a visit by keep cool's producer who 
 but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously 
 but unfortunately williamson and rodriguez did not take the story far enough in the sci-fi direction to make any use of it . in sum 
 but unprintable 
 but use them under very justifiable circumstances 
 but uses the same technique 
 but utterly generic 
 but very few tries actually click . i wondered if there were jokes that i wasn't getting because i'm not from china 
 but very little in character development . plot has suffered due to logistical error . here are some examples : a door-to-door search for the elusive bad guy in the largest building in the world . oh . . . that ought to take a few weeks . how about this ? the secretary's aide ( who is gay and is in love with the secretary ) hears the secretary ( right in front of him ) decide to betray the aide as the murderer of the secretary's girlfriend . what does the aide do ? he shoots himself ! it seems to me that if one is about to be betrayed by someone as omnipotent as the secretary of defense 
 but very little intelligence . visually there is much to like about this version 
 but virtually none of it is . the assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film 
 but waits another six years to do his next piece 
 but was cast when extensive reshoots took place months later ) . like most action movies 
 but was no doubt superior 
 but wasn't anything i'd lose sleep over . clearly 
 but we also learn of an equally powerful rod which unites the red dragons . are you with me so far ? there's a quiz afterwards . it's around this time that we meet the two young thieves 
 but we also learned very little about her 
 but we are left with the unpleasant impression that it could have been better . 
 but we are nevertheless expected to be devastated for her . the scene feels like an afterthought 
 but we are not given a chance to know her . the cast is decent however 
 but we aren't given any back story on her character 
 but we don't have a mutant killer baby slashing up victims -- that honor goes to margot ( superman ) kidder . we start off with de palma's favorite theme : voyeurism . on a corny television program called peeping toms 
 but we don't know anything about her character other than that it takes her an incredibly long time to realize the most obvious things . she also too closely resembles the stunningly beautiful kari wuhrer 
 but we learn very little about him 
 but we see them anyway

 guns and chases which may lure a viewer into thinking that he or she is about to experience an exciting thriller of some sort . do not be fooled . some may call this escapist fare -- i call it escape-as-quickly-as-you-can fare .

 guns waved around 
 gus gets the buzz on the right track . in fact 
 gussies up the film with lots of gold hues and pleasingly stylized action and they sell like proverbial hotcakes . every time something clever happens it's counterbalanced by something so overtly wrong that it jerks you back into realizing you're watching a movie . there's a innovative usage of black lighting that goes from being a novelty to a part of the plot . it's counterbalanced by an extremely feeble attempt at humor by having an asian american repeatedly failing a driver's test . imagine the yuks . there's a segment where one of the thieves shows another his cool fake fingerprint trick . it's countered by the lame semi-subplot of a car being stolen with a bunch of heroin in the trunk . the ramifications are never explored . then there's the ridiculousness of the many cops who actually shoot at fleeing cars . not only is it stupid

 he is easily the most charismatic person in the movie . like a blast of nitrous oxide 
 he is easily the most lively of the actors . everyone else comes across as half-asleep . the re-make is successful in that respect . it feels like a bad disney movie from the sixties . i remember the original as being charming

" he is very funny and entertaining and really keeps the film from being a total bust . the special effects of "" monkey bone "" is what might really bring in some curious viewers "
 he just adds throws in another story . for example halfway into the film mans innocently antagonizes some local toughs and a long chase is added to the film . characterization is a little better with roro than it is with mans who does not seem to have a whole lot more personality beyond fear for losing a biological function . we do see some of roro's family life and his concerns . that may be because roro's background is a lot like that of the director . while the story was entertaining 
 he just can't keep going on like this . 
 he just comes across as loud as obnoxious . the only enjoyable performance comes from the sexy salma hayek

 he makes a perfect candidate . unfortunately 
 he makes a promise to take him to the statue of liberty . . . you know the drill . now this is where the plot complicates ( well 
 he makes some rather blunt comments that he believes are true 
 he makes the fatal mistake of handing the audience a movie that has too much literal meaning and not enough space to let the audience digest one course before he crams another down our throats . it would have been a pleasant experience to see this film use violence 
 he manages to elicit some of the worst performances possible out of a skilled cast . only gary sinise rises slightly above the hackneyed material . the rest of the actors become caricatures in this by-the-numbers thriller . ryuichi sakamoto's atmospheric and melodramatic music dominates almost every scene . heavy on the long violin notes 
 he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle

 he plans to rule all 
 he plans to seek them out 
 he plays a man who's just looking out for himself 
 he plays the role perfectly in a twisted way where it is obvious that he is up to something just by the expressions on his face . however

 he seems more interested in the goofy side-characters it gives him a chance to introduce . among them are a loudmouth scottish film director ( tom hollander ) 
 he seems to be interested in her advances . father andrew's religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic . as for pryce 
 he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with sphere . this $100 million mess by good director barry levison ( disclosure ) is dull 
 he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place : the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which 
 he sends the sinister damodar ( bruce payne ) in hot pursuit . together

 he urinates on it and then crawls back into bed contentedly . like a parody of a bad art house movie 
 he used the directorial service of john landis

 he would do best to break free from van damme . . . before it's too late . if he continues his involvement with b-grade movies such as _knock_off_ 
 he wouldn't want to make another movie set near water 
 he'd convert to creationism on the spot . luckily for us 
 he'd rehash a lot of cliches

 he'll receive all of the credit if it succeeds . should you sacrifice your hard-earned cash to support murphy's risky gamble ? well 
 he's a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show . not that it ever makes a difference in the plot . there are only two scenes of him cooking . for the rest of the film 
 he's a shoo-in for the secret society . a mysterious invitation arrives 
 he's absolutely right 
" he's added "" eyes wide shut "" to that impeccable body of work and his final film is the first and only blot on his near-flawless copybook . this much-publicized psycho-sexual tease-a-thon "
 he's all by himself during the day . through a series of coincidences too irritating to relate 
 he's amish . this leads to some of the best comic scenes in the film 
 he's barely in the movie 
 he's basically learned to suck in his gut and take it all like a man . allegedly 
 he's boring 
 he's captured john's baby brother ! this prompts him to turn into a superhuman metal man with a cool suit and plenty of interesting gadgets . an action film easily more forgettable than batman & robin . at least batman had some flashly effects and cool scenes . this film is filled with countless scenes that are so bad 
 he's clairvoyant and he's got some major issues with mama 
 he's countered by a slew of jokes that aren't funny 
 he's crazy for her and she seems to be marraige material . so myles faces a choice 
" he's fun to watch . mark mckenney also is good as a screenwriter trying to pitch film ideas to the band's manager ( richard e . grant ) . one question though : george wendt ? you'd think that "" spice world "" would envoke one of two reactions in people . if you like the spice girls "

 he's good at setting up weird conspiracies 
" he's got to do whatever it takes to get the bail money for her . this means he's got to sell guns to ten year old kids . any sympathy i might have had for this character was gone after that . then there's "" the man "" "

 he's inexplicably missing for much of the film . still 
 he's lucky for that . early on in the movie 
 he's more pathetic than endearing . the film boasts several cameos ( most notably by steve buscemi and jon lovitz ) . but none of them work well at all . buscemi's role as a drunken best man simply fails to be humorous . lovitz 
 he's nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory . you can just lump him in with the supporting players 
 he's no better : he gives g nothing of importance to do 
 he's no serial killer but a total loony who does odd and tasteless things 
 he's only treated as a typical raving conspiracy buff . here 
 he's out working with the two untrusting agents 
 he's played by woody harrelson ) his name is big boy and he's in the same business . the two men constantly go to the bar 
 he's pretty much rodman . he's extremely colorful 
 he's rather boring . he squints

 he's so god dang self-involved that i hated him at about the 10 minute point . an interesting concept with a bad result 
 he's so open and kind . he is taken in and is subsequently transported on a commerical plane to la . this is already a problem . there is no way that convicts would be transported on the same commercial flight that normal passangers would be on . anyway 
 he's so smug 
" he's talking his head off ( he tells one of his co-workers "" think on this -- when's the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station ? "" as if it makes any kind of sense ) and it only gets better as he engages himself in an argument about the benefits of railroad over recreational vehicles . of course "
 he's terrible with dialogue 
 he's the best thing to hit comedy since robin williams . but when you put him in front of a camera 
 he's the star 
 he's ultimately already buried himself . - copyright 1999 by dustin putman http : //hometown . aol . com/filmfan16/index . html 
 he's unwilling to marry her . his reasons ? well he's a guy you see 
 he's willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a half-dozen dwarfs . ( the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever . ) after a series of missed opportunities

 his latest film does simply not engage . i believe that friedklin is a director that is absolutely depended on great scripts and talented producers in order to succeed . it's obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore a catastrophe . the characters feel designed

 his main goal is to get the film back . so why did he give it up in the first place ? ! the lawyer had the film the whole time

 his penchant for gore always hit the right note with theme of the film and plot . in existenz 
 his performance is forced . in the last ten minutes or so 
 his presence in a motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality . like everyone else 
 his primary concern was to save himself . libby at times shows this same determination but not nearly enough . ashley judd and bruce greenwood both are excellent actors but if they continue to do movies like this 
 his prose strikes a chilling 
 his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador 
 his second go-around in the role of pet detective ace ventura . that means more talking ass-cracks 
 his sexuality and his identity as a whole person on this planet . i guess that i was expecting the former going in . the film is somewhat interesting to a point 
 his somber part seems designed only to elicit our sympathy . besides paulie 
 his son doesn't believe that he's actually speaking to seagal 
" his talent is not . i first saw him in the independent dark comedy "" the house of yes "
 his unnecessarily flamboyant visual style somehow removes any genuine sense of excitement and suspense . van damme's performance is more wooden and unconvincing than ever

 i doubt douglas finds it very hard to play a stogie smoking 
 i doubt it will recoup its costs ( including marketing ) domestically . thank jan de bont for that : proving for the third time that speed was a fluke 
 i doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period . one of the reason would surely be films like national lampoon's loaded weapon 1 
 i drove 88 miles to the hood just to see a movie that a lot of theater owners in predominantly white neighborhoods were apparently too chicken to show . i desperately wanted to love this movie for both its message and the talent behind it . the message came through loud and clear ; but judging bamboozled on its creative merits alone 
 i ended up wishing a giant snake would come along and eat me

 i feel it is downright impossible to make a modern day pg-13 horror movie that is scary . unless you find obvious computer generated special effects frightening 
 i felt like i had wandered into a sequel to 
 i felt many associations could be drawn between mr . gumby and kevin costner as a filmmaker . costner is just so ploddingly 
 i felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times . the most irritating part of the film ( besides the fact that this is a christmas movie released in february ) is the number of chances the bad guys get to kill rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason . the routine in which the bad guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays 
 i find it guilty . but on the charges of racism i find this film not guilty 
 i find it odd that such a strangely insulting device ended up in the story . this is summer movie season 
 i find this film guilty . on the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking 
 i found his aim fairly accurate 
 i found it hard to watch the rest of the film 
 i found it thoroughly distracting 
 i found myself having an especially laborious time investing myself into a wide array of character that have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever . no attempt is made to flesh the roles into three-dimensional characters 
 i found myself thinking 
 i found this movie to be more depressing than comedic . the first half hour generated not one smile in me 
 i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) 
 i gave up on the minus man after 30 minutes . turned out there were 90 more to go . i don't know what the ultimate point of this film was supposed to be . that there are crazy people all around ? that life and film can ultimately lack meaning ? that rock stars ( crow ) can do whatever they want ? that once-great actors and writers can produce junk now and again ? 
 i gave watchers reborn a star and a half because bad horror / sci-fi film buffs may get a few kicks out of the film's silliness ( though this film will tax even their patience -- it's an 83 minute film 
 i generally tend to find something nice to say about most films . in that sense 
 i get kind of fed up after a while

 i guess . as a side note 
" i guess i should make note of the film's good points ( this won't take long ) . there is one good gore scene for all the gore lovers out there . anthony anderson does have a few funny moments . that about does it . one thing that really shocked me was that we had a serial killer dressed in fencing garb ( or at least the mask ) and we didn't get one "" en garde "" or "" touche "" . that just shows lack of ability on the parts of the writers ( hah ! as though everything else didn't ) . the film's score is decent enough "

( was that an actual sequence or a fantasy ? ) what ever happened to the lawsuit ? and more . . . all of which were part of the film and interested me somewhat . if the only idea behind the film was for the main character to uncover his/her sexuality "

 i knew for sure the movie was a stinker . but it wasn't until the very end that i finally put my finger on why : the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies ( such as young sherlock holmes ) but from cheesy prime-time sitcoms . in fact 
 i know 
 i learned that it was not to be screened for critics . and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs . and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique . my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things . the film i saw today didn't even meet those expectations . this is a lousy 
 i loitered in the theater lobby to catch a few comments . the general consensus seemed to be that 
 i lost all interest . there were attempts to get it back -- like having the aliens get stoned on sour milk 
 i made that last part up 
 i may have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are . it seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair amount of improvisational rights . we have all seen ben affleck have some fun on the set 
" i mean sec ! "" i was struck by a wave of revulsion "

" i measure my age in two digits .

 i might have cheered that the utter tripe was now well and truly over 
" i might not understand female behavior and am unequipped to analyze this particular pseudo-feminist coming-of-age story . fair enough . i'll pretend to ignore the mannered posturing and health class 101 "" this is a no-no "" dialogue when older teenage boy coaxes younger teenage girl to let him fuck her up the ass "
 i might say that i review movies that don't look particularly good because i'm doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it . if that were true 
 i might've declared it a masterpiece . as it is 
 i must admit that occasionally i am befuddled by certain things . i am befuddled by fight club . now sometimes our favorite films are panned by critics and do not achieve critical success until much later 
 i must confess to being afflicted by a massive fear of sharks . i remember reading about carpet sharks when i was a little kid 
 i must lean toward the former . maybe i am subconsciously affected by word of mouth that has been slowly leaking throughout the media for weeks that this film is pure gold . but if it is 
 i must say 
 i nearly fell out of my seat ) . to the movie's credit 
 i needed a goofy movie to revive me . so 
 i never felt the least bit of sympathy or pity for the philandering alcoholic during his moments of crisis . in fact 
 i never really wondered what the tarzan films would have been like had tarzan been an old man . while watching instinct

 i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times 
 i observed a couple of my colleagues in deep and earnest conversation 
 i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness . now 
 i personally don't care for those films 
 i personally remember those films as a ) starring a major motion picture star b ) being funny c ) having great action sequences d ) great chemistry e ) decent character development . hmmm . . . . okay . . . now on to my review of chill factor . plot : a graveyard shift regular working joe and ice cream truck driver fall onto a malicious plan by an ex-army general

 i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before 
" i realized that the mindset behind "" heartbreakers "" predated "" three's company . "" suddenly "
 i really did . maybe the plot was sort of basic 
 i really didn't laugh once . honestly . i mean 
 i really do . i think audiences are so starved for it that they'll flop down a lot of money in hopes that a movie will be original . payback's tagline - get ready to root for the bad guy - promised an original idea 
 i really don't feel guilty about wishing this movie death at the box-office . really 
 i really feel sorry for ll cool j . the man is not an untalented actor 
 i really gave a lot away there 
 i really wanted to enjoy left behind . the premise has all the makings of a crackerjack apocalyptic epic in the vein of stephen king's the stand crossed with the omen . if handled right

 i saw many movies that had in them what i believe you call torch singers . here queen latifah ( who is very good ) is liz bailey . i bet it is a reference to pearl bailey ( whom we adored in europe ) 
 i saw mighty joe young in a cinema packed with wailing children-it's a wonder i was able to decipher the dialogue . it's certainly not a film for very young kids-intense fighting scenes may scare them 
 i saw that in casualties of war . but lately 
 i saw this particular picture by myself 
 i saw woody harrelson playing the same type of woody-ized character that he always plays . this also goes for arquette

 i shall move onto something a little better about the movie ( for all you cynics out there the movie did have a few good things about it ) . the cast and acting was passable at the very least 
 i should have checked out in the very first scene 
" i should probably do this so i can work some more and survive in this business . "" it's just too bad for her that the script "

 i think it is not unreasonable for you to expect that the film is a comedy . whoa

 i think of a title first 
 i think seagal is probably the most boring action star to ever live . and this includes keanu reeves . what do i hate about seagal ? i hate how he uses one facial expression for every single threatening and non-threatening situation ( the squint ) . i hate those scenes in every movie where he goes around

" i want more . "" i say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good "
 i want to see her in a movie where she plays a person 
 i wanted some resolution to those pieces as well . i didn't get it . the film's humor also didn't tickle my funny bone either . then again 
 i wanted to slap that pompous grin off his mug . okay 
 i was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements 
 i was actually enjoying some of the film's first half hour 
 i was actually looking forward to seeing the new david spade comedy 
 i was amazed at how amateurish stone's performance was 
 i was as happy as a nine-year- old girl while watching this movie . 
 i was asking myself 
 i was beginning to think that i had simply outgrown them 
 i was checking my watch and my girlfriend ( a big fan of the original film ) started to nod off . this time around 
 i was driving down a straight road in the middle of a desert . no scenery except the horizon line and the converging parallel lines of the highway . no matter what i did 
 i was experiencing only three different emotions : bored 
 i was hoping it would be a bit more intelligent . practically every line is just stating the obvious . none of it is smart . also 
 i was hoping to see it . one tough cop isn't laughable 
 i was monumentally bored . after he first reel . in the latter 
 i was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film 
 i was never exactly bored while i was watching it 
 i was on a roll . broderick is usually a good actor 
 i was on caffeine when watching it 
 i was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences . it's just when i start to think about the story that my contempt for this film surfaces .  the picture feels like it's been hacked to pieces -- i wouldn't be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely .  the ones that are here are as bad as they come ( i think i let out a very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of the pirate ships ) 
 i was reading in the new york times george vecsey's analysis of the us women's soccer team victory . ( vecsey is both a paragon of sports writers and an excellent author of non-sports books 
 i was ready for some mindless fun--oh 
 i was right three times and wrong only once . that's not a good average for a production that wants to keep viewers in the dark about what's around the next corner . the ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie : the hot 
 i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . but i don't believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . if the farrellys are indeed good 
 i was wondering if there would even be a plot . i certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants 
 i wasn't necessarily impressed by any of its exterior shots 
 i wasn't that impressed with the first 'highlander' movie in 1986 but such films like 1992's 'medicine man' 
 i weep for society . mind you 
 i went into their first animated feature film 
 i will be forever scarred by this experience . to be sure 
 i will never pay to see this man's movies 
 i will not pay for your next movie so don’t e-mail me asking for money . ) the acting in the film is just horrible . hopkins does nothing in the role that he is accustomed to 
 i will not reveal . nor will you care . i will say this : you know you're in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope . willis has barely a chance to come alive ; ditto for affleck . their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act 
 i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic 
 i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination 
 i won't even get into that one . anchor bay has also released a limited edition ( only 50 
 i won't even get into that one . szwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds ( and everyone else agreed ) that supergirl needed to stand on its own 
" i won't go as far as to say that it's the "" worst movie of the year "" ( remember that i actually have to go see freddie prinze jr . movies also ! ) "
 i wonder how a movie like this one skirts the nc-17 rating . one scene 
 i wondered if the movie would have been better if it focused on this plot . in a defining scene of the movie 
 i wondered why anyone ever thought he could carry such a lame movie targeted at susceptible kids . it was one thing to scare the crap out of kids with the pg-13 kindergarten cop 
 i would be fairly hard-pressed to state an aspect of the film that i actually liked . aside from one flashback to when a man's young son died on the way to the doctor 
" i would glance about to see other audience members staring at the screen with looks of shock plastered on their faces . "" drowning mona "" is an amazingly evil "
 i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles . damn this movie for not giving them the chance . 
 i would have preferred either to the end result . to be fair 
 i would have walked out 
 i would recommend it to those of you who want to see how not to use digital technology . i suppose there are a few humorous scenes ( though i can't seem to remember what they were ) 
 i would say in practically every conduit and crevasse it could have . while watching `mission to mars' 
" i would say this is a big let down for the audience . upon arriving in "" the city "" "
 i would sure think twice about kissing a guy who doesn't even crack a smile through the whole movie 
 i would think there might be a chance that he would turn down the opportunity . why would steven plan the murder as a break-in in their apartment ? why not just take her out as she was walking to david's loft in a bad neighborhood ? while deciding among the numerous summer films 
 i wouldn't touch de palma with a 10-foot pole . sinise is a wonderful 
 i'd advise you to swerve around it . bob bloom is the film critic at the journal and courier in lafayette 
 i'd ask that 
 i'd definitely go with mortensen . less wrinkles . anyhow 
 i'd give it zero stars . but it's not boring : it's loud and excessive and completely incoherent . it's also funny 
 i'd go on scout camp . but no 
 i'd hate to see what he does with concepts he only has mild interest in . to say that his script lacks narrative cohesion is to imply that there is a narrative to begin with--which there most certainly is not . after the setup 
 i'd have guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something 
 i'd have laughed in his face . know what ? intersection is everything i've just mentioned . gere stars as vincent eastman 
 i'd imagine . foley's strength is clearly in characterization 
 i'd say even more contempt should be aimed at mr . bruno for making a movie that could be this bad . in fact 
 i'd seen them all at least once 
 i'd sneak up to the 612 . 6 ( by the dewey decimal system ) section of the stacks and grab up dr . david reuben's sex book 
 i'd still suggest you wait for video or at least catch a matinee . with any luck 
 i'll be surprised if i see anything this bad in the next ten years . based on the novel by scientology guru l . ron hubbard 
 i'll crack jokes anyway . after all 
 i'll give it a chance with the positives . there's a nice credit sequence 
 i'll know what that feeling was . now i know that in most of my reviews i reserve the second paragraph to describe the plot 
 i'll put an asterisk * for words easy to find in a dictionary . q : my first question is about the title that 
" i'll still consider "" me "
 i'm afraid i must . it's just that this time 
 i'm all for checking your brain at the door when going to the movies 
 i'm allotting one point alone to actress kathleen robertson 
 i'm ashamed to say 
 i'm beginning to wonder at what capacity 
 i'm even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw . i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago 
 i'm hoping americans everywhere will rise to the occasion and make young einstein a box office bomb . young einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious 
" i'm more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth . the movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webb's office door and enters . he gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up . the "" produced and directed by jack webb "" card pretty much goes without saying . this is his movie all the way "
" i'm more than a little irritated with him for giving up composing ( he composed the great theme to the equally great "" the usual suspects "" ) so he could direct a movie like this . no "
 i'm not a prom person 
" i'm not buying . from the writer/director of "" blue velvet "" and "" twin peaks "" comes another dark "
 i'm not convinced this is what the filmmakers had in mind . the whole movie is therefore seriously undermined because the key point in the plot is never credible . another problem is in the humor . you know 
 i'm not giving anything away by saying that sandler's team wins . if you would actually feel any degree of suspense watching this movie 
" i'm not giving one ounce of crap as to what they're talking about . i guess that's called lack of "" character development "" "
 i'm not going to reveal who the killer is 
 i'm not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain . what's worse 
 i'm not sure what frankie was posessed by . supposedly 
 i'm not sure which of the three main characters we're supposed to be sympathetic to : the cold-hearted husband 
 i'm off the hook : there is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off . for the sake of comparison

 i'm reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick ( such as from the smurfs 
 i'm scared 
 i'm so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous 
" i'm so sick of a movie's third act where they "" solve "" everything by blowing it up . it didn't work in zabriskie point "
 i'm sorry -- that's chest hair 
 i'm sorry to have to say this but the only horror in this film is its lame-ass script ! the wayans brothers should have known better than to look towards the weinstein brothers ( money ) instead of the zucker brothers ( comedy ) for this sequel . unfortunately for us 
 i'm still trying to determine what director christopher guest 
 i'm sure 
 i'm sure . consider it a hospitable gester 
 i'm sure even the most loyal british movie fan would be dying to rent a james bond movie 
 i'm sure he was precisely thinking of static 
 i'm sure he wouldn't want to risk the embarrassment of a third collaboration . the academy award-winner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell 
 i'm sure that you'll want to see it 
 i'm taller than daddy 
 i'm told . i call it pretentious . something lightweight striving to be something sophisticated through clever wordplay . in the end 
 i'm willing to wager than there were more laughs in saving private ryan than there are here . in fact 
 i've already mentioned that i didn't care for murphy's character 
 i've got cigars . the film's big climax has dreyfuss getting the kid to re-enact almost on cue what he witnessed . never mind if the people in the movie watching this thought it was believable : did anyone filming it think it was believable ? really ? 
 i've got it !  we'll throw in a distracting subplot in which her fiance has sex with a really attractive woman who acts like a bimbo 
 i've just been terrorized by a hook wielding sociopath and had some of my best friends gruesomely slaughtered 
 i've just checked the internet movie database and discovered that i am the 38th person to post a newsgroup review of payback . after this many reviews 
 i've never seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes until now . jeff daniels plays 'staple nice guy' and his role is useless . his performance is incredibly lazy 
 i've read a number of reviews with differing opinions 
 i've said enough about this movie . it's a waste of time and money . i liked the music

 imamura calmly and casually explores the idiosyncratic world of the futoris and their life on kuragejima with an almost documentary-like style . but all throughout the film is an ongoing subtext that ultimately relates back to the film's title . furthermore 
 imamura draws a few comedic moments with kariya . ) also in the film is grouchy grandpa futori ( kanjuro arashi )

 in a role that plays more like an afterthought than an actual character . finally

 in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich . sebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth ; there is no woman he can't have

 is this : virus is a bad movie . it rips off a lot of good movies that are worth seeing . in that order 
 is tommy lee jones in the role of mad bomber . his acting is so over-the-top that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himself . this role is in painful contrast with the strong performance given by that same actor in fugitive . the film have few bright points 
 is totally lost . and dustin hoffman himself does a reprise of the same territory he did with outbreak . no wonder they're content to just drift : the material they're given doesn't afford them a chance to really make their performances matter . so . when do we get a tarkovsky revival ?

 it all culminates into another braveheart rip-off human versus ape battle scene . while rick baker's makeup work is amazing 
 it all seemed perfect 
 it almost appears as if some of the actors are holding back their laughter . another thing that makes it bad is the fact that we a supposed to actually care for all of these characters when they are placed into danger 
 it also continues the owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie

 it did suck . but you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy . . . after all 
 it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie's dubbed films . the plot in mr . nice guy is negligible 
 it does have a certain charm in isolated scenes . broderick actually fares better playing robo gadget 
 it does have some rather hilarious scenes in it 
 it does include a fantastic portrayal of the attack itself 
 it does little more than try to cash in on that aspect . this movie would be best left for video and even then you might be advised to simply wait for one of the major networks to air it on tv . 
 it does not . it is a serious film ( seriously flawed if you ask me 
 it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film : it's laden with complex machinery 
 it does tend to be rather smug and a little too cute for its own good 
 it does try to have more multidimensional characters and even something resembling dramatic conflict - this time between power-hungry and scruples wallenberg and hedonistic womanhood symbolised by kitty . unfortunately 
 it doesn't exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind 
 it doesn't hold up well . then there is the series of lame jokes that result from magoo's near blindness 
 it doesn't make any sense -- and the conclusion the movie tries to draw from it is just plain limp . the effects are decent 
 it doesn't make sense for the movie and just looks dumb in my opinion ( and i am hoping many other peoples ) . i am hoping that in my little rant i've made it abundantly clear that the movie is lacking quite seriously in plot and uneven pacing 
" it doesn't matter which section of the "" robo-welder "" they are working on "

 it doesn't work at all . after a somewhat promising prologue in which the frost family is established 
 it downplays it so heavily it's totally unbelievable . could it be any more obvious martha is a boy ? he only wears a girl's wig 
 it fails . the characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting . finally 
 it falls flat because of its uncovered stupidity . i can't even call this film predictable 
 it feels almost unnecessary . rosenberg is obviously trying to give each of the players a distinctive personality but lacks the skill to do so 
 it follows the exploits of dade murphy 
 it gets irritating . ( 2 ) murphy wastes the talents of his fine cast . richard pryor 
 it gets old fast . the film often makes no sense ( a several-hundred foot tall beast hides in subway tunnels ) 
 it glorifies this is many ways . however 
 it had atmosphere to spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power . spawn is an in-your-face 
 it had shock value 
 it had the big battle scene at the end 
 it hardly qualifies as a motion picture . corky romano is an embarrassment 
 it has a few notable performances and i suppose it's pretty well directed 
 it has its moments ; how one can truly hate a movie in which huge ( really huge ) amounts of cocaine are delivered in school busses ? and to be fair 
 it is . awful 
 it is . the use of gloria as a subplot is also a very weak excuse to pile on the violence . even when she clubs him over the head 
 it is a 1940s-style b movie . a little humor would have helped the script some 
 it is a combination of all the cities in the world as things devised by computer for the film as seen from the hotel window view are the eifel tower in paris 
 it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later . follow the rules ? bah ! who needs the rules ! only uptight doctors follow the rules . the real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants . and then there's the free clinic issue

" it is a story about love . "" wary of local gold-diggers "
 it is a very bad mistake to make . ghosts of mars is called a horror movie 
 it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below . 1 ) we never see how cesar ( antonio banderas ) and vince ( woody harrelson ) meet . the two are so different from each other 
 it is absolutely necessary to remember that the muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the terrorist activity in and outside the united states . and that it's not a coincidence that u . s . residents in the middle east 
 it is almost never really boring 
 it is also a very poorly made film . it's predictable

 it is christmas eve and everyone is waiting to get to la and spend christmas eve there . well 
 it is clear that the camera's field of view does not singlemindedly represent any one particular perspective . and even if it were imamura's intention to make viewers into gods 
 it is clear the movie wants to be taken as farce . the press notes describes how everyone that came on the set remarked at what a good time all of the actors were having . too bad they weren't more concerned with the audience's potential enjoyment . the jokes 
 it is clear why they held it from the press . it is a film more to be endured than enjoyed . as the story opens 
 it is clearly the worst . i suppose i should have seen this coming . after all 
 it is devoid of any style . if the film is supposed to be tongue-in-cheek 
 it is difficult to stifle a yawn . the engineers bounce scientific theories back and forth 
 it is disorganized 
 it is found on the floor of its cage with a broken neck . finally 
 it is hard for me to admit that the film has redeeming qualities . but it does . first 
 it is hard to tell whether american movie is the genuine article or yet another of the increasing series of mock documentaries ( like bigger than tina 
" it is in the script . the film's only saving graces are a few well-executed suspense sequences and a really cool cameo by the "" re-animator himself "

" it is lost in the spiritual world of "" interesting ideas gone wildly awry "" . little known facts about this film and its stars : this film is based on the novel written by alice hoffman . co-screenwriter akiva goldsman also wrote the screenplay for 1997's batman & robin . director griffin dunne is known mainly as an actor in such films as an american werewolf in london and after hours . "
 it is merely artificial . and here and there are tentative take-offs 
 it is my belief that he or she would have a hard time distinguishing between the two characters . fiennes is wooden and his showdown with connery in the film's climax is laughably short 
 it is not a successful homecoming . told through the eyes of a 12-year-old irish boy 
 it is not something that these great actors can boast of . they have roles that they could play blindfolded with their hand on the back . jackson is gray and jones uninteresting . the rest of the cast 
 it is original . we men often wonder what women talk about when they are alone in groups 
 it is received as heresy 
 it is shame when we have veterans like gene hackman or robert duvall . even hill's directing is bellow expectations - battle scenes are too short and 
 it is she who must also shoulder much of the blame for the film's failings . this surprisingly bland and ultimately uninvolving film is set in the old fashioned and laid back 
 it is simply dreadful . a bunch of upper class twits

" it is to note that the actress was once named "" penthouse pet of the month "" in march of 1976 . she was known as one joann witty back then . she's originally from jersey . who the hell is loren dean "
 it is undeniably stupid . christian duguay's direction is also not that great . his camera angles and sense of style are all in place 
 it is well-hidden by cliches gathered from earlier flicks . chw's deja vu types and actions make up a pot-pourri 
 it is yet another example of how the teen slasher genre is in desperate need of either fresh ideas or a long rest . hopefully 
 it isn't 
 it isn't . as much as it scars me to say this ( har 
 it isn't a great film either 
 it isn't a howl 
 it just doesn't work ( in fact 
 it just exploits it . the irony 
 it just gets sillier and sillier . the film jaunts along from scene to scene 
 it just isn't the same . i kind of enjoyed happy gilmore and thought that it warranted a marginal recommendation 
 it just looks too feminine . i was imagining ear rings on him at that moment and it actually seemed funny . something that i'm sure wasn't intended and it shouldn't have been allowed to happen . dicaprio's hair in many scenes with his female companions actually looks longer than theirs does . perhaps appropriate

 it suffers from a grafted-on hollywood plot that one can hear squeaking and grinding blocks away . moore plays o'neil 
 it takes her more time than anyone to figure out that her niece is gifted 
 it takes time to see the obvious . i will not mention other characters 
 it teaches us that beautiful 
 it throws in some repugnant scenes 
 it took seven people to write 82-minutes worth of fart jokes 
 it took waaaaay too long to get going 
 it took yours truly about 60 of this film's 88 minutes to learn all the background presented above ; converting what seems at face value like an interesting story into little more than a tangle of bad editing and ambient noise . and let's talk about the noise for a moment . while it's perfectly understandable that filmmakers on a budget might not produce the best possible audio tracks 
 it tops the topper . it is not plain old pulp fiction either . much of it is what happens to pulp after it's been digested . 
 it transpires 
" it tries to follow in the footsteps of wes craven's highly entertaining "" scream "" with disasterous results . four teenagers celebrate their graduation from high school in typical teen age fashion . they drive to the beach "
 it tries too hard . the film wants to be soft 
 it turns out his name is vivian 
 it turns out that kahl isn't alone . many poor farmers in rural northwest share his extremist anti-government beliefs 
 it turns out that someone saw them or he's not dead or maybe . . . kathy bates turns in a credible 
 it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sam's reunion with his family . and some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is a valiant thing 
 it was a breath of fresh air 
 it was a bunch of unfunny crap in the army . murray 
" it was all a dream "" resolution . and guess what ? this movie has both ! not that the main body of the film "
 it was an awful lot of work to go through 
 it was bad 
 it was changed . there may be a loss of audience among some amateurs of teacher-murder 
 it was definitely not a movie that cried out for a sequel . and 
 it was directed very well by the talented paul anderson 
 it was entertaining and boasted an entertaining premise 
 it was everything that 8mm is not . in the opening minutes of 8mm 
 it was funny . there is not one laugh in the film . the re-make retains the goofiness 
 it was just about the time that douglas' character suddenly removed murphy's character from the mental home ( and how come she went with him so nicely ? i thought she didn't trust him ) 
" it was moments like this that made me wonder if "" urban legends "" was perhaps intended to be more a satire of slasher films than just a standard entry into the genre . but if that is the case "
 it was neither spiritual or the least bit engaging . in fact 
 it was not available on video 
 it was one big bore . i didn't see the point of the movie 
 it was only size 4 or 5 laughter on a scale of 1 to 10 . the view of american youth in mallrats tries to be funny 
 it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail ; this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs . dramatically 
 it wasn't entirely about her looks . the main idea was that she finally started to come out of her shell . her father encourages her to have a social life . the fact that she looks more attractive doesn't even come into play with him . there is something really disturbing about the danza's characters attitude about his daughter . it seems to be a innate fear of sexuality on behalf of the filmmakers . or maybe they just thought it would be funny . in the case of the latter 
 it will be a vindicated action 
 it will be completely random 
 it will never be seen again 
 it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers . i can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively 
 it will thrash about 
 it will wane . i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn't do any good to think . the avengers has clearly been chopped up and re-assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn't tell us what happens . there are several scenes in the preview that didn't make the final cut . in addition 
 it works . but the majority of the film is a convoluted and confusing mess . characters keep popping up with no explanation 
" it would be a movie called "" drowning mona "" "
 it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality 
 it would hardly be classified as a spoiler since the character is only introduced at that point . the only reason i gave this piece of garbage an extra half star is because of the performances of the two female leads . they both try valiantly to add something to this pitiful excuse for a horror movie 
 it would have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie . now the rest of the actors in the movie 
 it would have been another classic for cronenberg . cronenberg fans however 
 it would have been good if it were a music video 
 it would have served to make the film terrifying . what our mind fashions on it's own can be a thousand times more frightening than having having it completely led towards everything . apparently 
 it would probably be albert brooks tiger 
 it would take an incredible stretch of imagination to see him as magoo ( especially since we're reminded of the original by the short cartoon segments that open and close the film ) 
 it wouldn't have been such a tremendous disappointment . written 
" it wouldn't have worked . instead "" book of shadows "" acknowledges the first film as a movie and concentrates on the hysteria following its release . it's a great scheme and possibly the only entertaining way to do a sequel . unfortunately it doesn't work either . five kids spend the night in the woods at the scene of the first film . weird stuff happens and they retreat to an old factory where one of them lives . even weirder stuff happens . some people die "
 it'll be time much 
 it'll somehow pay off 
 it's 'never work with children and genetically enhanced killer animals' instead 
 it's a bore 
 it's a complicated 
 it's a declaration of war . hush has three very simple problems : it's incredibly dumb 
 it's a disappointment to see something this dumb and ugly come from christopher guest 
 it's a film that oozes with sentimentality . here's a note to all film makers : films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves . swelling 
 it's a good idea to show them on camera -- at least some of the time . about a third of macintosh's lines are spoken off-camera 
 it's a long damn sit . with no interesting characters 
 it's a long haul . it's not clear whether twist is supposed to be a celebration 
 it's a movie by a director who doesn't know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says it anyway . 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; sent via deja . com http : //www . deja . com/ share what you know . learn what you don't . 
 it's a pretty thin and tired one . to fill the gaps 
 it's a semi-interesting premise once you get past the fact that nancy drew could put these cops to shame . but of course 
 it's a sequel not worthy of the original . the film starts exactly eighteen years after the first one ended . elwood blues ( dan aykroyd ) is just getting out of jail 
 it's a standard romantic comedy with a very substandard gimmick . check out more current movie reviews at http : //www . indra . com/~mmapes 
 it's a tie -- they all win . that dragon's comedy shtick is awfully cloying 
 it's a time to be with your loved ones and enjoy a good 
 it's a warner bros . film 
 it's a waste of money 
 it's a wonder that it even got made . we already know that big movie studios' mentality is shallow at best 
 it's acceptable 
 it's accomplished in just four easy to follow steps : crack open your skull 
 it's actually the delivery that's off . i kept imagining what the dialogue would sound like if spoken more calmly 
 it's akin to 129 minutes of someone screaming punishments at you in a foreign tongue . ( aside 
" it's all bad news . the computer-generated werewolves look painfully unreal . the creatures would probably have been more believable had they been men in wolf suits . repeated use is made of the "" werewolf cam "" "
 it's all hat 
 it's all part of a needless 
 it's all ruined by shoddy acting and some just-plain-god-awful filmmaking that is shameful in its incompetence . reeves is utterly wooden 
 it's almost impossible to discuss ellis' flaws without him embracing them as part of his integrity . of course it's shallow 
 it's almost the only thing that's still around from the first film . in order to review mortal kombat : annihilation 
 it's also an assembly line product through and through 
 it's also distressing that the effects in this sequel are rather shoddy . in fact 
 it's also nowhere near exciting or suspenseful . claire danes' character has potential 
 it's amazing to think it's the same film you're watching . 8mm is far from an success 
 it's an 18 billion to one shot . and yet it happened here 
 it's an insult to every human being who has the misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny 
 it's an interactive game of sorts where you wander through different nightmare locations looking at objects which give you access to extra little snippets of footage 
 it's an unfortunate effort 
 it's another matter altogether . you're forced to swallow some pretty gruesome stuff . for instance 
 it's another popcorn film . for those of us who has 
 it's back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off-limits sables and minks and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown . the dogs are pretty cute--try making a puppy look otherwise--but that's pretty much all they are . there's always the feeling that there's a trainer off in the wings 
 it's based on a real man who probably has a good point to make . in the film 
 it's basically the same movie as last year's deep rising . i liked deep rising simply because it's funny -- it knows it's silly and derivative . virus takes itself seriously . and 
 it's because we wouldn't have a ( bad ) movie otherwise 
 it's been a red-letter day any time that warner has actually released a good film . '97 was their best run in a while 
 it's brazilia 
" it's by john ottman . "" urban legends : final cut "" runs 100 minutes "
 it's clear that this new look wild wild west is far removed from the original tv series 
 it's clichd . carpenter's need for close-ups 
 it's confusing 
 it's cringeworthy . watching some of the cinema patrons around me collapse with laughter made much ado about nothing a very weird movie going experience . comedy ? bah 
 it's curious that the ones here are cardboard characters . peter coyote as a man dying of cancer is refreshing because he seems like a real person . unfortunately he's in the film for only about two minutes . the audience is blatantly lead by a ring in its nose from scene to scene . we're not left to our own emotional decisions : we're hit over the head with them . shaved-headed children with cancer 
 it's david suchet . the director 
" it's difficult to begin . when the first crew is a few feet away from a raging massive upside-down martian tornado ( which looks remarkably like a sandworm from "" dune "" ) destroying everything in its path "
 it's difficult to determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author 
 it's difficult to judge this film . i have a suspicion that i'm not it's target audience . after all 
 it's difficult to see how it could have failed so miserably . but it does . the story is so full of holes that it falls apart within minutes of the opening credits . are we really supposed to believe that after a millennium of looking for gold 
 it's difficult to shake the thought that this pathetic former star hasn't aged a day since growing pains . his behavior 
 it's downright boring 
 it's downright dumb . if this were a hong kong action comedy 
 it's downright terrible . in fact 
 it's embarrassing . it's clear from the observations of betty ( romantini ) begg 
 it's embarrassing to watch a respected actress of lange's stature give a performance like this -- it's like a bad blanche dubois ( the role she played in a 1995 tv version of a streetcar named desire ) . meanwhile 
 it's even more insufferable and dessicated than the book it was taken from . the story opens up in castle rock 
 it's even worse . i'm insulted that these filmmakers would think tony danza in a neckbrace is funny . that very thought is as repulsive to me as anything in the doom generation . there is not one scene in this film that even approaches humor . it's not as if there are missed opportunities 
" it's fair to find our kicks where we may . "" original sin "" will never join such treasures as "" valley of the dolls "
 it's filled with extraneous subplots and characters 
 it's fine that he's slept with numerous slave girls 
 it's going to be just a xerox . obviously successful films need both skills . brian de palma is a masterful technician . he's spent his career copying others 
 it's going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikki's friend lysterine ( vivica a . fox ) 
 it's hard to find someone to root for . you're supposed to back the good guys 
 it's hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming 'the man' . and yet - film after film 
 it's hard to tell . either way 
 it's hard to understand why the rights were optioned . sphere is the kind of first- class mess that only a top-line director with an a-list cast can create . with expectations high ( and how could they not be 
 it's horrible schlock 
 it's important as well ) . he's hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery . after her husband's death she comes across a film in his private safe . it appears to be snuff film 
 it's impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer's ideas . they're not real 
 it's impossible to like or sympathize with a bunch of putzes like this . director todd holland completely fails to develop any character into something more substantial than a device to implement various dubious gags . meanwhile 
 it's impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation . maybe someone should ask him if he's familiar with oedipus . martha is 
 it's impossible to tell whether she's being matter-of-fact or glib about them ( they carry an almost documentary starkness ) 
 it's in pretty good shape for a guy who's been dead at least a decade ! ) and tries to scam whatever little pockets of civilization are left into offering him shelter 
 it's incredibly boring 
 it's just bogged down in razzle dazzle and flashbacks . it also gives itself away far too quickly 
 it's just infuriating to watch . the camera cuts all over the place 
 it's just not fun at all . and i can't wait for it to premier on mst3k . 
 it's just not very disturbing . schumacher also has no idea how to shock and audience 
 it's just plain dumb and boring . marty wants the p . i . to kill abby and ray 
 it's just that with something that moves as quickly as this crocodile does on land 
" it's just typical b movie trash disguised as an intricate crime story . the characters all seem to be going crazy and there's no explanation for this insanity . the film essentially becomes a horror flick by the end with three dead bodies and no reasoning . "" blood simple "" definitely has a tremendous amount of potential "
 it's just watching an old guy ogling his younger daughter and trying to prevent any boys from getting near her . todd solondz should've directed this . his approach would've been much more interesting . as it is 
 it's kevin bacon who plays the super smart military bio-molecular research scientist ? something sounds horribly wrong already . but this is a paul verhoeven film 
 it's less than 90 minutes . wow ! it really does resemble a t . v . movie ! 
 it's like watching a guy slip on a banana peel . it might be funny the first time 
 it's likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes . unfortunately 
 it's love at first sight . to pad out its ninety-minute length 
 it's mom and against wife 
 it's much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures . spawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons ( white ) who is framed by a corporate baddie ( played without irony by sheen ) 
 it's much worse than a sin . this is sacrilege . 
 it's nearly impossible to look at the young empress savina ( thora birch 
 it's never crossed anyone's mind that the real equation is quality films = more profit . often 
 it's no closer to having said anything in its final 10 minutes than in its opening running time of the same length . set in hollywood hills 
 it's no contest 
 it's no longer funny 
 it's no mystery . the predictable 
 it's no surprise that _polish_wedding_'s plot complications are far from involving . naturally 
 it's not 
 it's not a character we're seeing on the screen 
 it's not an easy task creating such a movie 
 it's not as nearly as violent as many other action films your child's already seen . good age : 11-12 additional note : this film also made the internet movie database's top 10 worst films of the 90s . 
 it's not crimson tide 
" it's not exactly a linear storyline . "" love to kill "" should be praised for trying to do something different with the well worn crime genre "
 it's not executed well enough to be a fun 
 it's not much i remember from this 'production' . as in almost every summer movie 
 it's not only a waste of time 
" it's not quite worth it . there are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or no purpose . take for example the extended sequence where one of billy's scuzzy friends defends a stray puppy . the film is filled with these "" character moments "" that never really achieve anything . granted "
 it's not really on display here . tons of characters show up for no reason 
 it's not very good . donahue 
 it's obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead . the only thing that distinguishes species 2 is how awful it is . if you throw away the plot 
" it's oddly predicable . "" the blair witch project "" was a rare triumph of style over substance . "" the book of shadows "" is a triumph of tedium over promise . ( michael redman has written this column for over 25 years . for the first time during that period "
 it's okay when slasher movies rip-off each other 
 it's one that i would definitely not want to subject myself to sitting thru again . like i said 
" it's only a movie "" "
 it's only fair to quote some of it 
 it's permanent . julia roberts is a photographer in love with lawyer ed harris ( in a completely wasted role ) . harris' ex-wife ( susan sarandon ) lives alone and the couple have an older daughter and a younger son . the kids hate dad's new main squeeze and despite her attempt to like and please them 
 it's poorly-conceived ( it would have made a fine short film ) . for all its instructional aspirations 
 it's possible that sphere may end up pleasing no one . action lovers will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup . audience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by the film's sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending 
 it's pretty bad . and that makes it even harder to forgive the bad acting 
 it's pretty much obvious that leaving this film leaves a horribly unsatisfied taste in one's mouth 
" it's quite another for the writers to cram that message down your throat . singh and protosevich do just that in "" the cell "" "
 it's real but you won't care one bit . also along for the socially unredeeming ride is phil ( chazz palminteri ) . phil is an ex-con who always wears a leather jacket and tries to pass himself off as the gq end of the movie business . nothing more than a hollywood wannabe 
" it's really illogical to say that "" i "" _still_ know what "" you "" did _last_ summer . the filmmakers would have at least made sense with the shorter "" i still know "
 it's revealed that jade is involved in a custody battle over her son . inevitably 
 it's ruined by poor execution . the follow-up to one of the most successful horror films ever is nothing more than a bad slasher movie . they're trapped in an old big weird house . they stupidly separate into various rooms . there are strange noises 
" it's so choppy and unclear that i didn't know what happened to a major character until catching it a second time . intended as a bleak comedy about the "" gun control problem "" "
 it's so saccharine and treacly . not too far into the future 
 it's so spontaneously surrealistic it makes your head spin all while being confusing enough to make your head spin twice as fast in the other direction . i hope another film is made from an ed wood screenplay for i woke up early the day i died is not a fitting send-off . 1999 eugene novikov &#137 ; sent via deja . com http : //www . deja . com/ share what you know . learn what you don't . 
 it's something that's painful to watch because it relishes in its flaws . kevin costner stars as a man who is some kind of mutant half man/half fish . he is an explorer/mariner on an alternate earth that is completely covered by water because the polar ice caps melted . he's referred to as the mariner 
 it's still a fun story . powerful underdog 
 it's still annoying . now despite all this negativity ( and i'm not alone here . . . supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles ) 
 it's still early and i'm sure there are a few more garbage heaps coming down the pike ) . skip this one altogether and rent any of the indiana jones movies instead . . . trust me 
 it's that i don't see much box-office support developing for this lame 
 it's that what can be funny for 1/2 a minute probably usually won't make it for 91 . oh 
 it's the bad plot that aborts this production . driven by randomness 
 it's the fact that grant is annoying . not just adam sandler-annoying 
 it's the main plot of the movie that sends the message that it's okay to do whatever it takes to get your hands on what you want . maybe that's what christmas is like at the schwarzenegger house 
 it's the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever . he essentially says to her 
" it's the rider . "" unfortunately clear-thinking is not always the reaction to problems . wall street wheeler dealer steven taylor ( michael douglas ) is a man with troubles . he's sunk his money in illegal financial activities and it's blown up in his face . in a matter of days he will lose it all . his wife emily ( gwyneth paltrow ) is a highly-placed un interpreter and is not happy with her life either . her marriage is cold and unfulfilling . unknown to her "
 it's the set design . the sets ( by stuart craig ) are big 
 it's the standard boy-meets-girl 
 it's the way it's broken down scene-by-scene 
 it's the writing that's clearly at fault here . one 
 it's this movie 
 it's this one . don't knock the look 
 it's time to get a life . get monty python . get woody allen . get john waters . whatever . just get a real taste of some clever 
 it's time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father-daughter conflict 
" it's too bad you can't go on this mission because you were determined 'psychologically inadequate' because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together "" -- does anyone really talk like this ? can't we find out these things in a less grating matter "
 it's too much for him . he claims that he wants to be in control of his own destiny 
 it's up to our group of mismatched protagonists to 1 ) solve the mystery 
 it's up to wayne and j . d . to try and begin saving silverman . the performances are topnotch and surprisingly 
 it's watchable . raul julia does a good job 
 italian soldiers spent a lot of time conquering europe . but as one particular caesar ages 
" its "" trashy potboiler "" nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished . "
 its addressed . ( though the media are suspiciously absent from the institutions that are referenced . ) all of them play an important role . how so ? well 
 its blood dripping into water 
 its commendable to see genders reversed in the film 
 its completely worthless . chris klein and leelee sobieski are two of my current favorite young performers 
 its depressing . we get loving shots of large nails being hammered into feet and hands 
 its emotion manipulative and shallow . these scenes grow worse and worse 
 its failings go much deeper . first off 
 its hucksters and its public 
 its main action will be a confrontation with genuine evil in an apparently cheerful 
" its main problem is that it's simply too jumbled . it starts off "" normal "" but then downshifts into this "" fantasy "" world in which you "
 its makers managed to cram more moments of ungodly torture into an 86-minute musical than i could ever have thought possible . the saddest thing about the fantasticks is the inclusion in its cast of cabaret's memorable emcee 
 its phony and self indulgent on beatty's part . what's even more astonishing about this film is the way that beatty presents not only the other characters in the film 
 its purported sequel 
 its rabid plotlessness ( cruella goes after puppies again ; winds up in goo again ) and most of all 
 its rhythm is punctuated by thunder . ( the script by de palma and lost world's david koepp sets the action during a hurricane in an attempt to pump up the adrenaline level and the noise . only the latter is achieved . ) cage plays rick santoro 
 its script isn't funny or particularly charming . the script has a fundamental problem : annie gives up 
 its sequel's stunning ineptitude is not terribly surprising 
 its the whole package and this package is really well done . the whole movie is really well done and looks really good and if one was to overlook the flaws in the plot and characters then this is really a movie . the special effects are just amazing 
 its title sequence with a frightening rap song and a black limo making its way through the dark streets of new york 
 its unique style wore thin after about 20 minutes 
 itself a remake of the 1950 movie by the same title . the original was a nice

 lawrence is a mediocre eddie murphy stuck playing another jewel thief in another run-of-the-mill studio comedy . worst revolves around a ridiculous cat-and-mouse game between a thief named kevin caffery ( lawrence ) who gets caught burglarizing media conglomerate ceo max fairbanks ( danny devito )

 nothing spectacular aside from the cinematography but it still has promise . this is where things start to degenerate to something that becomes almost un-watchable . there is even a 'video game' style sequence that borders on the disgusting

 o'neil -- sorry 
 obligations damned . however 
 obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization . the general's daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film -- it pretends to have a soul 
 obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus 
 obligatory exercise in genre film-making . if i hadn't recently watched the matrix and open your eyes -- both of which are similar but far superior -- i might have been a little nicer to this picture . craig bierko makes an adequate hero as douglas hall 
 obligatory pilot with a troubled past jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) 
 oblivious to jasmine's concerns . we also find that he has been relentlessly asking jasmine to participate in a menage- a-trois 
 obnoxious 
 obscure 
 obsessive compulsive computer geeks a little too advanced for reality ) running around hacking computers and staying away from the fbi . thanks to this movie 
 obvious dullard . there is no contrast to any of the characters . by having at least one character with some wit 
 obvious scenes of creepy noises coming from nowhere clear 
 obviously 
 obviously . i wouldn't recommend it for the little kids 
 obviously for practical filmmaking reasons . the opening credits are a quick 
 obviously it hasn't worked since the $75 million dollar movie has yet to break $5 million . to each it's own however 
 obviously making this film longer than it should be . the actors are good 
 occasional screams and weird sound effects 
" occasionally saved mostly by excellent acting ( elizabeth perkins was right on mark as wilma ) and one of the classic example of mortal hollywood disease known as "" high concept "" . after great hype "
 occult groups dressed in egyptian garb . there's even a pyramid with a floating eye on the back of u . s . currency . 
 occupies himself by making weird faces at the camera when he is not called upon to run around wildly and beat people up . lack of dialogue makes him the ultimate caricature . the carnival side-show climax manages to demonstrate everything that is wrong with this no-budget production . it's desperately unfunny 
" oddly lyrical yet based-on-fact killing spree movie i would recommend "" badlands "" ( 1973 ) with martin sheen and sissy spacek . entering mexico "
 oddly--who wanted to work with whom i wonder ? )

 of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys' last effort 
" of course it's nihilistic ! that's the world he created . see how slippery he is ? what was that great bill murray quote from rushmore ? "" money can buy a lot of things "
 of gonzo journalism 
 of good scenes in kissing a fool . i enjoyed a moment in a comedy club 
 of stealing . raymond then proceed to beat ( and bite ) him to a bloody wreck . but these are the least of billy's problems . billy is a heroin addict on the downturn 
 of the apes . that could be a good story too 
 of the dark humor of bunuel and other spaniards 
 of the film is the music . and the film is packed with it ( even during and after the ending credits ) . although there are no brilliant mergers of comedy and song as in the original's rawhide/stand by your man medley 
 of the process of its making and of the influence it might have : for example 
 of the work of american director paul bartel 
 off the possessed frankie 
 off the two of them go to dunwich to save the world 
 off-again relationship with bob ( maxwell caulfield ) 
 off-again relationship with joe's best friend 
 off-the-wall comedy 
 offering precious few momentary pleasures along the way . no looking back is dominated by three very dislikable characters whose constant presence on the screen is painful . the most appropriate ending would have been a triple suicide 
 offering weak spoofs of that nike shoe ad in which everyone does acrobatics with a basketball 
 offers a patchy soundtrack that veers between eerie 
 offers to give them a lift to town . although jeff rejects the offer ( he wants to stay with his car ) 
 officers ? ! anyway 
 often cheating shots to avoid showing the entire house of a millionaire or upper middle class couple in ways which limit the film visually . the final montage where everything heats up and blows 
 often complain of repetitive plot devices . it's definately not a koontz book if there isn't ( 1 ) a psychic 
 often exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par with brian depalma and martin scorsese and a storytelling ability comparable to steven spielberg . but here 
 often eye-popping camera work by peter pau and rodman's lite brite locks 
 often laughing at each other's goofy/embarrassing antics 
 often launching into bone dry 
 often protesting far too much for comfort . i don't hate women ! american psycho is a feminist tract ! less than zero was not autobiographical ! it's a sensationalized version of my post-college years . this vain little man seems to care an awful lot about what people think of him . oh 
 often reacting to the computer screens in his room which purportedly reflect his games but seem to display his own manic thoughts ( which sometimes involve violence and guns 
 often turn out not to be so . populating this bad tv-movie-of-the-week material are a host of talented actors . one can only hope they were rewarded handsomely for acting in this hopelessly muddled picture . besides the obvious hardships of acting most scenes while dog paddling in the water 
 often unintelligible and - judging from their highly icky hygiene habits -- pretty smelly to boot 
 often with no clear purpose . the scenes i did manage to follow were repetitive and silly : every now and again a new obstacle would come up 
 oh 
 oh my god ! everyone in the prison is not being treated with proper respect . ok 
 oh what talent lies in the minds of these screenwriters ( and yes 
 oil rig worker 
 ok ? at least the farrelly brothers got back on track with mary or i'd still be a little bit irked . 
 ok performance . i think since he is getting a little older he is held back a lot of his stunts . the thing that disappointed me was the fact that there was nothing to the film . in the trailers it looks like a good scary 
 okay 
 okay ? and as for comparisons to seven . . . oh please ! kiss the girls is based on the novel by james patterson and written for the screen by one david klass . maybe the novel was a stinker to start with

 one could conclude that the film is little more than an indulgent effort to equate the real god back to imamura himself . while imamura has played similar tricks in his other films -- most notably in his 1967 film ningen johatsu ( a man vanishes ) where imamura surreptitiously photographed a woman who is searching for her missing fiance and who falls in love with the fake interviewer-investigator imamura paid to accompany her -- there is no such sense of egotism in kamigami no fukaki yokubo because imamura never calls undue attention to his camera tricks . he also does not carry anything to gratuitous extremes . imamura is certainly fascinated by the dirty laundry of humankind

 she snaps at harry for even positing that the volcano could erupt . perhaps her ancestors invested in some pompeii real estate . there are a couple of good things about this movie . the first is the scenery . there are panoramic shots of forests 
 she somehow falls in love with lilly's paparazzo joey ( danny nucci ) . meanwhile 
 she somehow makes a delicious crab dish for him 
 she sounds a lot like her poison ivy character from 'batman and robin' . in fact 
 she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon . even more curiously 
" she succeeds . shakespeare wrote "" out of this nettle "
 she takes off in a hot air balloon with bond dangling from a guy rope beneath her but is still unable to take him out . these reliable absurdities are more frustrating than usual since there are no distractions other than occasional ads for luxury automobiles 
 she threatens to leave him if his work continues to dominate his life . a bit much after showing her support earlier in the film . it seems totally out of character for her and a contradiction on the writer's part . big 
 she walks in to find everyone greeting her like she's just come back from holiday 
 she wants to but the rules of this type of film require him to find out later ( preferably right after they first make love ) . this way garret can get very angry and the relationship can be threatened . the discovery of the message and garret's discovery that theresa discovered the message are really the only two noteworthy events that happen during the nearly two and a quarter hour running time of this film . there's a truly lame subplot about garret's relationship with his dead wife's family ( he gets into a bar fight with her brother 
 she will eventually decide to give him a second chance if he'll clean up his act . the tone in skin deep is all wrong ; edwards treats a very serious issue far too lightly 
 she will get her revenge in the obligatory ending bloodbath in which she will decapitate and castrate the boys and crush the girls with burning timbers . as the movie marks time until its big finale 
 she wins a vacation to the bahamas for four people 
 she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother ; now 
 she won't have sex until she's in love ( is this really a * moral * issue ? ) 
 she yells 
 she'd start sticking her finger in her throat . and she's right 
 she'll rest by herself . after all 
 she's a cable news personality . so there she is 
 she's a master of put-downs which inevitably make all wilt in her presence and all hate her . she even uses her unpleasantness to get her wishes via innuendoes 
 she's all that and never been kissed ) is because the writers of those films seem to realize that high school is a joke and write their scripts accordingly . i don't know what the writer's intention was with drive me crazy . there was some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting to . here there's nothing . . . just teens whining about who's going to take them to the big dance . do me a favor kids 
 she's been a kind of first lady all along 
 she's borderline inept . braced for a knee-jerk reaction from the art house crowd ( mortified shock or compulsory applause will suffice ) 
 she's cheerily redecorating his apartment . ( heckerling is so laissez-faire about the issue in general that she reserves the comeuppance of the would-be rapists for jokey epilogue titles . ) goth veneer aside 
 she's going back to jail . director bruce beresford spends way too much time trying to convince the audience that libby misses her son . every other scene 
 she's going to be able to relate to him 
 she's hardly the kind of woman who would inspire even a moment's interest 
 she's naughty . . . this is what big grown-up people call a 'wanton lifestyle' ! meanwhile a priest played by gabriel byrne 
 she's not bad at all . i wouldn't mind horribly if i saw her again . . . in some other film 
 she's not showing any results 
 she's not too devastated since she gets over it in about two minutes ) . when gillian calls sally to come get her after having another abusive spat with visjnic 
 she's out of control is the worst film of 1989 
 she's out of control was released . it was about a girl who 
 she's out to protect joe 
 she's rather stiff 
" she's saddled with some of the most unlikely dialogue the screenplay has to offer . theo's assessment of the house ? "" i love it ! sort of charles foster kane meets the munsters . "" who on earth would say that in place of "" citizen kane meets the munsters "" ? ( furthermore "
 she's so awfully clumsy ! oh please ! there's wit in here somewhere 
 she's the sole reason this overcooked souffle isn't completely fit for the garbage disposal 
 sheds any light on the characters

 so .1
 so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense 
 so any actor could conceivably portray him . of course 
 so as far as i'm concerned 
 so be it . i was very impressed by his performance 
 so brilliantly captured under michael ritchie's direction 
 so bunz and rushon go out and get them . oh 
 so chances are you've heard that now-famous outcry and the techno music that follows it 
 so cliched 
 so deliberately self-mocking all around 
 so delightfully eccentric as the off-kilter airhead phoebe in `friends' 
 so disappointing that most of the people these days associate the title with the 1992 thriller in which nicole eggert did few nude scenes . the movie begins in the prison in northern ireland 
 so does the entire mood . no attention is paid to the location of the story 
 so even when it turns sour it doesn't seem as bad as it is . dangerfield finally gets his respect in the end 
" so everyone has nightmares . . . or something like that . rather complex ( in fact more than it needs to be ) "" monkey bone "" had potential in the script and even the story . what is considerably noticeable is the gaping plot holes "
 so good . but the movie takes a sudden dive past the first 35-40 minutes and keeps shedding ratings stars . the balance is devoted to whitman's relentless pursuit and stalking of martha . unreasonably jealous 
" so good . but then : "" they're preparing for war . the situation in europe is getting really tense right now . opposing countries are getting ready for armed conflict "
 so he can't go to school . his dad ( kevin kilner ) is away on business and his mom ( haviland morris ) has to run errands 
 so he could have at least added a few worthwhile elements 
 so he employs the services of dr . catherine deane ( jennifer lopez ) 
 so he gladly accepts the job and does whatever it takes to make his dream a reality . well 
 so he hits one in the face with a can and breaks a few fingers . this gets their attention to a certain extent 
 so he makes all the villains unbelievably stupid and a bunch of jerks . michael caine 
 so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies . consequently 
 so he put on numerous layers of heavy clothing and went jogging in 100 degree heat 
 so he puts on the uniform ( hey 
 so he seems a poor casting choice for a social reject . as a social reject 
 so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning . we get an endless parade of quick-cuts 
" so he tells them the story of the vietnam war : "" see "
 so he's just kind of stuck with constantly brooding . charlie 
 so hour and half spent in front of the screen shouldn't be the total waste of time . 
 so i decided to check it out when it was released on video . the film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town . the town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption . flaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky 
 so i give it * 1/2 stars . 
 so i guess that means we root for them . they have tickets 
 so i only gave it one star ) 
 so i really feel bad for it 
" so i suppose it's only fair that we get a "" black "" effort of the same low caliber . as in all romantic comedies "
 so i won't hold them to that . what i will hold them to is the fact that they have a pretty bad movie on their hands 
 so i'll never work there . beginning with opening scenes that are relatively entertaining ( the first ten minutes had me watching hopefully ) 
 so if there's any subtlety to be found 
 so if you go see it and you don't like it because of this don't blame me . the character development was not up to par either ; i found the character of richard to be nothing more than a spoiled child . although there is a feeble attempt to make this whole story profound it fails and richard ( leo's character ) comes off as a wannabe philosopher . the character seems to be underdeveloped from the get go and seems to just do things for no apparent reason 
 so if you want a review devoid of spoilers 
" so impressive in "" american beauty "
 so in the side plot 
 so it doesn't surprise me that the farrelly brothers would be the ones adapting it for the screen . being a farrelly brothers movie 
 so it had some emotional charge and didn't just become a pretentious cogitation on man's tendency to ruin the gifts god gave him . his hero was a perceptive 
" so it is especially unfortunate that it wasn't to service a more quality film . "" the rugrats movie "" is doa from the start . i am all for a worthwhile family movie "
 so it is hard for this to translate into celebrities who appear in movies . anthony hopkins on the other hand apparently wants us to always think of him as a crazed madman behind bars . this is the only reason i could come up with for him to take the leading role in instinct 
 so it was a little hard to pick up . not much could have really happened though . the main events in this long two-hour film are explicit homosexual and heterosexual sex 
" so it's almost forgivable when you realize they're talking to nothing and interacting with nothing . it's safe to say everything that could be bad about "" flubber "" is . the only original element the film has is the world's first romance between a machine and a human . but this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it "
 so it's no surprise that the film looks good . unfortunately 
 so jack might even prove his innocence in the end . belonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller 
 so joe finally agrees to take a part in a madonna video . but it's not really madonna starring in the video but a lookalike ( played by elizabeth berkley 
 so let me just give you an outline . james west ( smith 
 so let's start the bleeding ! the fact that she's clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn't help 
" so let's start with one of the things that does work : director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in a few scenes during the middle of the film . that's it . everything else fails . the failure isn't de palma's fault ; he's working from an atrocious script . only during the sequence aboard the ship ( looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in "" 2001 "" ) where the rescue team's air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up does "" mission to mars "" come to life . a scene where they attempt to save a comrade floating away into space also provides some tension "
 so long as i didn't allow the melodramatic voice-over and lobotomizing editing to get to me . and batman has nothing on the spectacular visuals spawn's outfit created . but even the effects got tiresome during the final scenes 
 so long as you weed out the unnecessary from the . . . well 
 so miscalculated that -- while it would serve as a clever pun -- a term like boneheaded' seems just too generous . 
 so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan 
 so much that the film becomes a race to see which one can out-bland the others . in the end 
 so much that when the characters journey to a mental institution in the third act 
 so no comparisons will be made . but i have seen father of the bride ii and i can tell you that if you want to see steve martin in fine fettle in a good picture 
 so none of the americans come off looking evil . when the level of the storytelling becomes apparent 
 so of course 
 so of course he's hesitant . eventually 
 so ominous and original 
 so one has to wonder why they didn't just lock her in the attic . like the kennedys . but carla has other plans . she wants to enroll in a public vocational school . her parents say no but eventually give in . she wants her own apartment . her parents say no but eventually give in . she wants a boyfriend . her parents say no buthey ! are you tired of reading this yet ? try sitting through 130 minutes of it . lewis is remarkably unremarkable as carla . but 
 so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be . phillippe plays ( check out this name ) sebastian valmont . wow . isn't that a memorable name ? i could just say it over and over again . sebastian valmont . it kind of rolls off the tongue 
 so ruthless barons and emperors across the galaxy negotiate to get their greedy stinking hands on as much of it as possible . he who controls the spice controls the universe . with his eye on the prize 
 so save yourself eight dollars and watch three episodes of that series back to back . -bill chambers ; march 
 so screw them for not trying as hard ( critically speaking 
 so senile that he's taking orders from his first officer . inexplicably 
 so she poses a lot and does ballet-type maneuvers . also 
 so should i have expected an oscar-caliber film ? no 
 so stay seated ) 
 so stay tuned 
 so thankfully 
 so that draw is out . there are 
 so that he can close a deal . to do this 
 so that nixes any reason to see firestorm . 
 so that they become even less than stereotypes . they become walking wardrobes . small-town transplant paul ( a strangely static jason biggs ) 
" so that we could actually "" get into "" it and care about them . i didn't care about anyone in this movie "
 so the acting is not up to par 
 so the audience could barely care about his efforts . and the daughter is only seen from danza's perspective 
 so the film is completely stuck - not sure of what to be . and in the end it's nothing . there are no performances worthy of notice 
 so the premise is not just far-fetched 
 so the screenwriter introduced the subplot dealing with the black boy who gets adopted by norris . that caused another problem - any questions about nature of that relationship had to be quashed with another subplot - this one dealing with lady lawyer who sleeps with the hero and gets killed after fulfilling that screenplay obligation . the photography in this film is dark 
 so the script and acting suck . but what about the special effects ? thankfully 
 so there are no predecessors to work from 
 so there is ample room for improvement . unfortunately 
 so there is no way we can warm up to her . basically what we are left with is catherine hicks almost approaching charm . that would account for the half star . other than that 
 so they added romantic interest for their hero - public defender played by deborah raffin and conveniently terminated in order to give some more motives for kersey's crusade . on the other hand 
 so they can be argued to be a matched pair . after all 
 so they come back and by more 
" so they could sarcastically comment on their absurd situation . but scott and kutcher are given little more to do than say "" shibby "" and "" sweet "" in a frat-boy cadence . . . and then break things . and that's a shame "
 so they decided to make the film more fun by adding cool gadgets 
 so they don't have any opportunity to be surprised by it . the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called 
" so they got rid of me . "" paulie "
 so they move to chicago . max is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins . sam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money 
 so they send a new member of their faculty 
 so they tape him to a chair 
 so they try to salvage the ship . soon 
 so they use a space station to get onto a ship ( which is surrounded by water 
 so thin and juiceless 
 so this critique will likely be lost on anyone who cares . would that they would put their collective foot down . the last thing we need is another bad movie that simply serves as an excuse to sell a soundtrack . 
 so this is important ! ) lady lara needs to keep the pieces from the enemy 
 so this torture will end . how this pitiful excuse for a script managed to attract an actor of samuel jackson's caliber will forever be a mystery to me . all i can figure 
 so those aren't exactly the words he uses 
 so to screw up even one of these is no small matter . the story involves a thirtysomething married couple -- happy 
 so to speak 
 so two stunt-butts were employed for a couple of semi-nude shots . blucas 
" so ultimately we're left with nothing interesting but a couple of sexy shots of joely richardson . elton based "" maybe baby "" on his novel "" inconceivable "" "
 so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth 
 so we actually figured most of it out by the half-way point 
 so we can write him off as a prick . everyone else falls in love . but still 
 so we feel no sympathy for her character . the bookseller would be better off without her . although the second half of the film causes us to lose a lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well 
 so we're given little insight into who they are 
 so we're left with a ho-hum relationship based on enchanted eclairs ; it's not going to last long 
" so we're treated to long takes of "" wash my hairy back "" or "" my turn to wash your back . "" since ozon so clearly wants to titillate and shock his audience "
 so what's the significance ? okay 
 so when he has to beat up bad guys 
 so when sly calls him 
 so who is it aimed at ? and why is it told like a 91-minute sit-com instead of a feature film ? rodney dangerfield stars as chester lee 
" so why add this extra running time to the film ? the answer : it looked cool . or how about the "" atmosphere "" ? the beginning of the general's daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south - thick trees "
 so why aren't we seeing storyboards of those segments ( especially the parody moments from the matrix ) ? i wonder what's funnier : the fact that any moment in this film required storyboards or that di$ney thought fans of this film would want to see them ? deleted scenes ? sure . audio commentary ? you betcha . but storyboards ? come on . [r] reviewed by chuck dowling - chuckd21@fdn . com aol instant messenger : filmjax the jacksonville film journal - http : //www . jaxfilmjournal . com/ 
" so why can't thurman resist maniacal laughter when describing a girl's head on a stick ? by discussing the "" meaning "" of his books "
 so why do i need to watch the movie ? seen the trailer . . . seen the film . only a quick cameo from norm macdonald ( and a follow up joke during the closing credits ) generates any chuckles . deuce bigalow : male gigolo is available on dvd from touchstone home video ( a division of di$ney ) . the disc includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 
 so why mix the two together ? it doesn't make any sense . there really isn't much of a plot here because the story moves so quickly it never takes time to explain anything . the only thing we learn is that the prodigy child 
 so why not break with the boys' current liaisons ? it's not only a dumb idea but a revoltingly cynical one . learning this 
 so why should it work now ? there's not much variety in the movie 
 so why should we be surprised ? and the sense of scary atmosphere 
 so why should we even care ? kitty played well by rose mcgowan ha a story behind her 
 so why shouldn't the personality-challenged be attracted ? the implausible plot has max asking his best friend 
" so why torture us with a feature film ? "" mystery men "" also disappointed at the box office "
 so you get the sense that he's not only irresponsible

 such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages ( although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren't bilingual ) . the only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because ( a ) it's different

 the author of this review decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt . however

 the best being the scene swiped directly from bananas . in this case 
 the best choices ( for bruce willis or any other action hero ) are on video . and 
 the best known of those would have to be star trek . bean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved . now another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly . the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people 
 the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself . in one great scene

 the black cat - but they are nonetheless films with more inspiration 
 the blair witch project amounts to nothing more than a missed opportunity . the biggest mistake the film makes is to let three mediocre actors the chance to improvise . most of the dialogue is ad-libbed

 the brainy one 
 the brave good guys ( lambert and henstridge ) go after him . that's it . 76 minutes never seemed so long . this is a drawn-out chase scene through dimly-lit abandoned buildings turned into an entire movie . the plot development is nil ; we learn absolutely nothing about lambert's character and very little about henstridge's character . the dialogue is littered with unnecessary obscenities and concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguments over who will go down the next dark corridor/tunnel/airduct next and who will carry the flashlight . a subplot does exist involving henstridge's character's illegal attempt to get her son out of boston . in her opening monologue

 the characters do speak 
 the characters flat and two dimensional . certainly not good factors for a film passing itself off for a thriller . the most depressing aspect of the film is that it had potential . there's a good story buried in snake eyes 
 the characters here are only present as a formality : they do little more than state the obvious ( of * course * joe is too big for that cage ) . paxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them . sadly 
 the characters scream silently 
 the charismatic and mannered sinise often looks like he belongs in another movie entirely - say

 the dialogue becomes difficult to comprehend . for this alone it will be a problem for modern audiences unschooled in shakespeare and in search of nothing more than a good 
 the dialogue terribly clichd and the characters one dimensional . scott silver's direction is pedestrian . the three stars lack rapport 
 the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes . it's certainly not a bad film for kids ; i doubt joe will give them nightmares . but adults in the audience aren't likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla . a big gorilla is only interesting for a little while ; after that 
 the directing is nowhere near as good as in the original 
 the director can't get the small parts right 
 the director elects to wardrobe all of his female protagonists in loosely-buttoned sweaters so that the minute bacon's character gets invisible he can head straight for them . it's as if that fascinating concept--what would you do if no one could see you ? --is simply a verhoeven ploy to show some skin . as a horror film 
 the director has made some strange casting choices 
 the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement ( although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally ) . of course 
" the director of such box-office hits as "" tootsie "" and "" out of africa "

 the evil dr . claw ( everett ) will pontificate on how his moniker is `one word

 the execs are in charge of a rapidly-failing home shopping network which hawks various utterly unsellable products . they desperately need to revamp things . one day 
 the execution isn't even half as good as the idea . thus 
 the expectations of who will survive or not is killed five minutes after you meet them . the problem is that every character is not likable . the two who come closest to being civilized are a womanizer ( taye diggs - who should be doing films a lot better than this with all of his talent ) and a businesswoman who accepts being womanized ( ali larter ) . the characters presented are so annoying and pathetic 
" the experience is somewhat different . it is obvious that a story like this story is very difficult to structure . it's one thing to say : "" wouldn't it be fun to have death take human form and come down to earth . . "" to create a motion picture out of this is another . four screenwriters have worked on a script that lacks drive and logic . it is overlong and too primitive to pass as a serious film . on the other hand it demonstrates incredible performances and a very decent direction by martin brest ( "" scent of a woman "" ) . hopkins looks great in any role "

 the face of this once intriguing villain has been unrightfully exposed - it's . . . rupert everett ? ! only now 
 the fact that i liked it has a lot to do with the cinematography and the sheer beauty of the movie not its plot or story . as it is the story tries to be much too philosophical and fails at its attempt . if you do end up going to see this movie be forewarned about its shortcomings . february 21

 the fight goes on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile 
 the film at least lookd great 
 the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills . there are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab a hostage and get away . also 
 the film can't even set up situations where a laugh would be possible . danza's behavior makes him into a complete jerk 
 the film centres around sethe ( winfrey ) 
 the film degenerates into the worst dissection of the virgin/whore complex since milk money . girl toys with the idea of reforming her con-girl past 
 the film director equivalent of someone who'd take your arthritic father to a rave 
 the film does concentrate mostly on public debate 
 the film does contain one legitimate scare : it leaves itself open for a sequel . be afraid 
" the film does have its explosive moments ( courtesy the five-and-dime "" special "" effects ) "
 the film doesn't even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details . how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary ? how come an atheist like her was chosen 
 the film doesn't keep the mystery for long 
 the film doesn't stick because it doesn't entertain 
 the film dosen't progress very fast . in fact 
 the film drags on for the aforementioned 2 1/2 hours 
 the film even treats the audience like idiots . it tries to get away with things ( like leaving a critical piece of evidence in a rather unlikely place ) without even batting an eye . then again an audience which accepts characters as shallow as these isn't one that's likely to question details . jessica lange's martha is the only semi-developed character in the film 
 the film explodes into violence . and just when you think it's finally over 
" the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society . the two "" sides "" are represented primarily by arroway and by far-right fundamentalists "
 the film finds him still living with his parents on tasmania 
 the film focuses on a snowball fight subplot and an inevitably oversentimental climax that could be telegraphed before i even sat down to watch the movie . the performances are respectable enough 
 the film follows the original novel storyline very closely . as such 
 the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes 
 the film gets my * star . 
" the film has banning falling for the man she's supposed to be investigating . whether or not a remake should incorporate things found in the original is beside the point . i have always found john mctiernan to be a director better suited to action films than anything else . having done the first and third installments in the 'die hard' trilogy along with 'predator' made mctiernan a formidable director of action . he is not suited for dialogue layered pictures where interaction and sub text are needed . his films become shallow in this regard . mctiernan tries to inject a little antic he used in 'die hard' . there's a scene in 'the thomas crown affair' where he has brosnan use those little explosive hockey puck devices that explode and create lots of smoke that develop a diversion to the scene . one thing that really bothered me about 'the thomas crown affair' was the downright staging of the whole thing . getting actors to say their lines in a convincing way is not easy and it's made even more complicated by the fact that it doesn't help to mumble . have you ever seen those programs about "" the making of "" a certain film where you see the actors on the set talking between takes --- either to each other or to the audience and there is a lot of noise around that drowns out what they're saying so it isn't totally clear ? that's a large part of this film and many of the scenes look as if they've been done with only a couple of takes . pierce brosnan is one of those actors who's only tailor made for a certain role and his latest attempts at portraying 007 james bond have been good ones but his attempts at anything else have been mediocre at best . rene russo has also been bitten somewhat by the stereotype bug . after turns in two 'lethal weapon' films and a stint as a secret service agent in 'in the line of fire' in 1993 "
 the film has no idea what genre to be . levison can't handle his own plot . it leaps from hokey sci-fi 
 the film has provocative tastelessness at times 
 the film has to depend on natural 
 the film introduces a stereotypically pudgy 
 the film is a double whammy of intended satire but comes off more as a series of condescending failed scenes which do nothing to advance the nature of the movie's characters and caricatures . caricatures are usually the least interesting thing about a film that centres on people because they never get developed beyond the realm of their first scene ( s ) 
 the film is at a dead end . although there are some fantastic shots by de palma 
" the film is basically retreading the old "" fish out of water "" tale for the umpteenth time "
 the film is boring . so boring in fact 
 the film is climaxes 
 the film is given the power to show exactly how horrific these creatures can be . in past horror films 
 the film is heavily bogged down with unfunny jokes 
 the film is littered with star cameos . from elton john to elvis costello 
 the film is mind boggingly unscary 
 the film is more or less a countdown to her death . well . . why is this happening ? as a form of extreme punishment on a non-believer 
 the film is neither scary nor unpredictable . the plot involves five people who are dared to spend the night in a haunted house for one million dollars by an amusement park owner ( geoffrey rush ) . each character is a failure in the external world and acknowledges that they would do anything for that money . since the characters are immediately generalized as either greedy or caring 
 the film is not giving its viewers enough credit . the inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions . why are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends ? why do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine ? if nikki is so obsessed with safe sex 
 the film is not particularly bad : i wouldn't say the cinematography bothered me 
 the film is packed to the gills with cameo musician appearances . b . b . king 
 the film is seriously lacking a sense of humour . the jokes that are uttered are pathetic 
 the film is very much like the abyss ( 1988 ) 
 the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset . information on the characters is literally spoon-fed to the audience ( would it be that hard to show us instead of telling us ? ) 
 the film is well into its home stretch . so the rest of the time we are treated to patrick 
 the film isn't smart enough to play upon the drag aspect . in fact 
" the film itself doesn't appear to have a brain in its head . the film sticks so close to the worn-out conventions of the "" creature "" genre that it is amazing anyone would spend the money and time filming it when they could be making an original film . the actors are all very good and have all proven their acting abilities in the past "
 the film itself is rather artlessly constructed . a couple of scenes use a disconcerting method of jump cut editing . every line of dialogue in one scene is obviously cut together from several takes 
 the film lacks any real sense of passion 
 the film left me with another question : what was the point ? abruptly ending without any susceptible momentum 
 the film limps along at best . boyum attempts to keep the pace moving by staging stunts 
 the film making siblings better known for their deliberately dumb and low brow sense of humour that shaped the clever and hilarious there's something about mary and dumb and dumber . outside providence centres around 17 year old tim dunphy ( shawn hatosy 
 the film may deliver some chills 
 the film never achieves suspense 
 the film plays in no particular order 
 the film plummets straight down after that 
 the film proceeds imperturbably 
 the film shifts focus back to the mafia issue . whatever neat mesh the screenwriter wanted to create between the two stories failed miserably . aside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as a mafioso ( an insult if you ask me ) the performances were pretty good . baldwin 
 the film sounds more like senseful than senseless 
 the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing . nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresa's secret 
 the film takes a bite into race-related issues 
 the film tells a few substories ( such as the tale of a woeful absinthe bender 
 the film took on the rest of the world . thirty years later 
 the film uses english as its primary language . however 
 the film uses loud sound effects that sound like they were lifted from a cheap horror movie . the camera shots are heavy on the avant-garde angles -- lots of wide-angle close-ups and distorted shots filmed through colored-glass reflections . the director is much more interested in filmmaking style than in the substance of the story with the result being a sterile examination of a lonely and vain man . daniel craig 
 the film wants to be a slapstick comedy 
 the film wants to be over . shelton 
 the film was bumped twice 
 the film would be half as long . that would be great for the authors 
 the film would be stronger . i have great faith in crowe's ability to make us long for that family with him . unspecified 
 the film's best scene occurs late one night when george has to get up to go to the bathroom . mistaking francis's picture of a toilet for the genuine article 
 the film's closing image shows some promise for a potentially interesting ( but unlikely ) sequel . perhaps you'd be better off waiting for that one . 
 the film's female lead 
 the film's few feeble attempts at drama inevitably fail . the comedy in skin deep doesn't fare much better . most of the jokes are dumb 
 the film's forays outside the realm of comedy are pathetic . take for example the film's framing device of an old lady and her dog . the story serves absolutely no purpose 
 the film's only hope is to go for parody 
 the filmmakers aren't quite sure if their audience will understand that he is evil . how do they fix that ? make specific efforts to show that his character is the only one in the film who smokes ! there are lots of ominous shots of michael ironside smoking . . . oooooo scary . but even that wasn't enough for the filmmakers apparently 
" the filmmakers get it right ( "" clear and present danger "
 the filmmakers have piled on weird supporting characters for acting vets like betty buckley 
 the filmmakers opted not to do nudity . to be honest 
 the filmmakers round up the usual suspects 
 the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions and screeching cars 
 the filmmakers take on the haunted house-ghost story format which 
 the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned 
" the filmmakers wanted her to be "" graceful "" "
 the films were almost always fun 
 the finished product 
 the finished product is bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep the gears from stopping entirely . perhaps worst of all 
 the first 85 minutes are just a warm-up for the ending 
 the first feature film targeted at ten year-olds with the sensibilities of an adult . or maybe at adults with the mindset of a ten year-old ; frankly 
" the first half-hour of "" analyze this "" was very funny . unfortunately "

 the flimsy portrayal of the east compton troupe ensures that their rivalry with the rancho carne cheerleaders is all but devoid of tension or excitement . it is difficult for the audience to get excited about a competition when one side is virtually unknown . also unimpressive is peyton reed's pedantic direction . whereas movies of this sort often excel at showcasing their subject material 
 the flintstones did the excellent job in bringing the animated series to life . computer effects are flawless

 the hardest thing to do is stay awake . the film's major problem is that it tries to seem more clever than it is . david mamet's dialogue 
 the haunting is not scary -- at all . instead it's just a conglomeration of cheap fright tactics and a booming bass track meant to get you to jump out of your seat . which doesn't work . the haunting also features such a dumb story line and such bad dialogue it's almost pathetic . for a horror film to be frequently * boring * is unforgivable . and i wager that anyone who bothers to spend money on this lemon won't be able to forgive themselves either . a really cool set ( that ultimately serves no purpose ) is the only shining spot in the film . otherwise

 the luster has faded . some movie makers have only one good film in them . with back- to-back duds like she's the one and no looking back to follow the delightful brothers 
 the main asset in this movie 
 the main character . most of what this film has to offer is in the visuals . the visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog . this tends to limit close looks at the makeup . in general it seems much improved from 1968 . the makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers 
 the main characters are lifted right out of sit-coms 
 the main male presence is bon jovi's . he is a house painter 
 the main one being that wilder ( and the script ) go way over-the-top with the stupid quota on this one . it takes the fact that the twins are mixed up as the film's 100 minute joke . it also doesn't really help seeing what donald sutherland looked like when he was younger either . ( i actually do feel very sorry for him . ) but the worst thing is that the film breaks an alltime rule . any film with orson welles is either good or funny . horribly broken here as he appears for commentry before the film and as part of the film's extremely strange ending .

 the movie becomes a science project left in the school refrigerator to rot over the summer . orlando jones 
 the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer ( the omen ) meanders toward its sad ending . since it's rarely funny or convincingly dramatic 
 the movie begins with not one but two car chases . there's nothing like a good old car chase to introduce the characters in a movie . screenwriter randy feldman's brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on tv . his shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything the movie has going for it 
 the movie belongs entirely to ms mirren . england's helen mirren has been on much tv and many films for decades . she is a great actress who 
" the movie could have been called "" joe : ape in the city . "" theron ( so good in devil's advocate ) and paxton ( so good in the recent a simple plan ) are fine actors "
 the movie did conclude in a very simple 
 the movie does contain a few good scenes - all of which you can see in the trailers . let's hope billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie . my giant runs too long even at just 1 : 37 . it is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up . my son jeffrey and his friend matthew 
 the movie ends up being something that just doesn't work . now if they only had raymond burr . . . .

 the movie is propaganda in favor of kids picking up books 
 the movie is so intent on giving you a hoot-inducing 
 the movie is that predictable . the story is full of very shallow characters that don't do much other than subsist . the captain of the tug

 the movie makes one yearn for a fast forward button on the theater's armrest . with material this bad 
 the movie makes the most of location shooting 
" the movie meanders along insulting the viewers' intelligence in almost every frame . the script by james frey and the director is filled with vapid actors who read meaningless lines you've heard before . ( "" i'm not wearing any underwear "
 the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role 
 the movie never finds enough social nuances in its display of guns in the homes of the rich 
 the movie not only includes a great deal of nudity 
 the movie obviously has some fun scenes 
 the movie often seems deliberately campy 
 the movie presents evidence that any of these three men could be the perpetrator 
" the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are "" smokejumpers . "" we then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl "
 the movie quickly plummets and degenerates into a poor excuse for a comedy . young einstein is hampered by its lethargic pace and inane plot . yahoo must be an mtv addict because his movie features an omnipresent soundtrack ; unfortunately 
 the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the tried-and-true hollywood melodrama 
 the movie stinks . nuff said . 
 the movie takes a turn further downhill . its low point may have you looking for an airline barf bag . after phil's girlfriend digs up a big mount of moist soil 
 the movie treats sexual fetishes -- and sadomasochism in particular -- as if it's a perversion of everything we know to be pure . this standpoint is certainly allowed 
 the movie turns into a series of music videos with a few bits of acting in between . those hoping for an interesting and/or funny yarn are given too many musical interludes while those heavily interested in the music are given too much of a story . only the extremely avid blues fans should attempt getting thru these two hours . for those people 
 the movie wanders from scene to scene with little more purpose than filling 100 minutes before we get to the inevitable showdown at the end . this has been a successful m . o . for action films for a century -- but few have had the gall to try to work in a god vs . devil plot . the film is so over the top that maggie's car

 the museum security and anyone else involved in the case are made to look like bumbling idiots who can't do anything right . to further bother the frequent movie goer 
 the music blasts through the theater 
 the music booms dramatically ; barry pepper eats a raw rat 
 the music is altogether gratuitous and quickly becomes overbearing . almost every other scene includes a blaring rock song that leaves you wondering whether you are watching a movie or a music video . the instrumental score 
 the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind . basically 
 the music is very much enjoyable . to top it off 
 the music is very very sad . but the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions . real drama is character-based . you grow to like someone 
 the music pauses here and there to allow in the familiar plot . if simply copying the original blues brothers wasn't bad enough 
 the musical sensation of tom jones and harvey schmidt comes inexplicably to the big screen . that's right 
 the muttering of children's voices and over-the-top special effects 
 the mystery element is terrible . it's painfully obvious who the killer is . i won't say here of course

 the only character worth noting - other than 2 cute small parts played by cheech marin and gina rowlands - is the speech-impaired marie 
 the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe ( michael keaton ) 
 the only difference is fake teeth . keaton's mother is purposefully and pleasantly annoying while skerritt is just plan scary sans facial hair . sister was written and directed by garry marshall 
 the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill . take a scene where he's being followed by some agents into a parking garage : he quickly sprays his car another color 
 the only female hacker in the film . really 
 the only good thing about it is its technical achievement . this film can boast of great sound 
 the only half-convincing actor in the film is the golden retriever who plays einstein . you know a movie is bad when a dog outacts all of its human counterparts . i find it difficult to relate how laughable the action sequences are in this movie . and the creature ! yes 
 the only legal opinion crawford has ever put forth being that she favors the death penalty for anyone who wears white after labor day . nonetheless 
 the only other interesting performance comes from patricia clarkson

 the patient is not cooperative and the doctor only has a few hours to comply with their demands 
 the peak form of humor in `hanging up' is represented by some of matthau's nasty quips and ryan's eternal battle to have the aforementioned pooch swallow a pill . that about accounts for the three or four chuckles you will expel during the film . my curiosity has suddenly been tweaked to discover how such a promising and star-studded approach could turn so viciously sour . but really 
 the people behind this film are obviously idiots

" the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented : watchers reborn . "" maybe it won't be * that * bad "" he may say to himself . "" perhaps "
 the phantom also has a secret identity but this is so poorly played out you won't even care . about the only things i can recommend are a good performance by jones 
 the pianist . this film was originally titled the haunting of hill house . 
" the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book . ( "" without goliath "
 the plan goes south 
 the plane crashes 
 the platt character explains that freshwater crocs do not usually attack _in_ the water . so 
 the plot is framed by a climactic wedding 
 the plot is just screaming for help . the whole premise that the movie is based on is to say the least flawed . the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through and in many causes ad-libbed as you went . don't go into this movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece . but if this form of humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie 
 the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner ( although it doesn't take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant ) 
 the plot picks up as karla wins a trip to the bahamas 
 the plot thickens and jeff goes on a chase to find his wife . although comparisons can be made with this film to deliverance ( 1972 ) and the vanishing ( 1993 ) plot wise 
" the plot twists get too contrived too quickly . probably around the time degeneres' gumcracking gumshoe appears . at least the former "" ellen "" star is going for something a little different . arquette turns in yet another of her stiletto-heeled "

" the producers clearly haven't the foggiest idea of how the ntsb works ( kristofferson to press conference : "" we'll have our findings for you in a couple of days "
 the producers did not need to make a good film in order to ensure that every teenager in the world will see it . but i wish they at least tried . 
 the producers of this film chose the title screwed over such options as ballbusted 
 the production design by bo welch is pleasing to the eye 
 the production values are so shoddy that there are some scenes in the midst of this near-blizzard when a shining sun can be seen . if it's a wonderful life could generate real- looking snow back in the 1940s 
 the programming director at a home shopping network . sales are way down 
 the project was probably doomed even before the cameras rolled . murphy's awful script is the culprit . let's count the mistakes he makes in his first attempt at screenwriting : ( 1 ) murphy shatters the record for the most profanity in a motion picture . yes 
 the promotional key ring was cool . the problem is that fox won't be giving out key rings to regular movie-goers 
 the psychlo aliens have ruled our planet for 1 
" the psychlo never discovered fort knox ? or that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that time -- and gassed up ? or that the cavemen become such expert pilots in seven days that they can easily down the advanced alien ships ? or that the psychlo spy cameras somehow don't notice that their slaves are missing for days ? travolta prances across the screen hamming it up for all he's worth and is almost entertaining . almost . the rest of the actors are wooden mannequins trying not to laugh while delivering lines that no person -- "" man-animal "" or not -- would ever utter . some of the film _looks_ good "

 the public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do . this movie makes computers look a little bit too advanced for their time 
 the punch line is ruined . i felt the same way watching drowning mona . skip a stone across water and you approximate the depth of this attempt at an ensemble comedy . there are some slightly successful attempts at humor

 the raucous and often raunchy comedy is wrapped in a blanket of bogus sincerity . darryl goes through the experiment in order to help his cash-strapped family 
 the reaction to the film may be that it is a parody of a bad indie film . the acting is amateurish

 the screen also changes from black and white to color at random . the redeeming values are few and far between . it's respectable that negroponte would try to teach the masses about such a subject and that the subjects aren't portrayed as perfect geniuses of noble personality . the structure of the film is pleasantly tight ; none of the scenes are particularly over-extended . but while it is human tendency to turn to technology to fix things 
 the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien teachers . perhaps williamson has it in mind to champion these up-and-comers to the fame that their scream and last summer counterparts achieved ; but to do that

 the seams are that much more obvious . you have to be severely visually impaired to not be distracted when a grainy shot of penny and blawp is immediately followed by a crystal-clear solo reaction shot of judy . new line is hoping lost in space will become a big franchise much like the long-running star trek cash cow at paramount . i don't think so . in a few years

 the thought of a black man venturing unobtrusively through the frontier and battling villainous plots is a little too incredible to swallow . the film is set in 1869

 the various social groups he points out are general 
 the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny . there was not enough cleverness or variety . it is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay . penis jokes work only so many times . showing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags . they were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford

 the waterboy is about as funny as a root canal . seriously

 their accomplishments 
 their characters run out of gas quickly . 
 their class has the usual ritualistic bash--in the home of a girl who ought to have known better than volunteer the place . the party is a rite of passage --not the rites of spring but the trites of spring . the motto 
 their faces are full of the dirt that encased the worm they have just ingested . meet the deedles runs about an hour and a half . it is rated pg for a little bathroom humor and would be acceptable for kids around 6 and up . my son jeffrey and his friend nickolas 
 their faces becoming horribly disfigured . kevin does not help matters by dismissing his wife . he does not spend more time with her as he explains to milton that he needs to spend as much time on the case as possible to get it over with 
" their faces seem to say something like : "" what if he's one of those wackos who insinuates themselves into your life and kills your dog ? "" now right there is something more interesting than anything that actually happens in the movie . see "
 their given name . 'bulworth' has more than its share of unnecessary players and the centre piece of the movie's main personality is a man with a pretty unattractive personality named jay billington bulworth ( warren beatty ) . i understood completely where beatty was trying to go with this film but rather than churn out a political satire 
" their island offers them the opportunity to absorb parts of the world that haven't been trodden on . one of them describes it as a "" beach resort for people who can't stand beach resorts "" . the dream doesn't last "
 their jeep decides to break down 
 their king 
 their lips finally meet in a kiss . as they pull back 
 their lives 
 their love affair leads to trouble and dire consequnces for george . i have a confession to make - i may have given the impression that there is a coherent plot . there is not . instead 
 their minds seem to be affected by the grim areas in which they're working . the film's title is derived from salvaged reel-to-reel audio-recorded sessions involving the demonic possession of a young woman who is suffering from multiple personalities . by the time session 9 occurs so do dreadful disasters . filmmaker brad anderson obviously envisioned this as a gruesome chainsaw-massacre-type ghost story but the script lacks structure and isn't particularly scary . the conclusion is more ludicrous than convincing . on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 
 their parents die when they are still children 
 their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants . the dialogue consists of nothing but one-liners 
" their routines are filmed in a dull and commonplace manner . as much time is spent on sending up the sport as it is on portraying the real trials and tribulations it incurs . there is little in "" bring it on "" to suggest that cheerleaders are "

 then ended the film . but noooo 
 then focus all of his attention on his wife . not helping matters is the fact that kevin is having ideas about a possible affair with a sexy lawyer ( connie nielson ) also working with the firm . mary ann falls deeper into her madness as kevin spends more time away from home . kevin eventually looses control of his life and has to institutionalize his wife 
 then gave it away to the private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case and return the film ? ! it's totally absurd . . . and this is the screenwriter of seven ? late in the film there's a confrontation between all the main characters 
 then god be with you . the only things that keep this bomb from getting the big banana are the winning performances from henry winkler as the insecure coach and the severely underrated fairuza balk as bobby's love interest . i mean 
 then goes into two more satisfying climaxes before we all have a smoke during the end credits and bask in the afterglow of what we've seen . since everything . . . is such an uneven movie

 then i felt as if we were getting the mere crust of the story . granted 
 then i have learned things about figgis that i'm better off not knowing . the moments in nic's life are pointlessly intercut with scenes of a modern adam and eve . the irony of the film is that we see nic in so many stages of life

 then it also fails . i found nothing even remotely funny about the boozing parents who seemed

 then the doors open back up again . a good joke 
 then the film will be still harder to take . but what if evil is a real moral stance 
 then the good son might be a nice little thriller for you 
 then the macho one-upmanship begins . it doesn't stop with seeing who can juggle three 747s within a cat's whisker of each other . oh no . there are some broken hoop dreams

 then we get to see sunhill get in her car and drive off . they both seem kind of happy . maybe they were driving away from simon west . 
 then we would really have had something interesting -- a movie that doesn't rely on the strength of its actors . 
 then what's the point of an extended sex scene ? titillation 
 then why are they only one thread away from bursting out of their skimpy outfits ? the film is pg 
 then why could two dense teenagers who couldn't figure out there was something going on until it was way too late find information on him in a couple minutes ? the film

 then you'd better do it ( because gassing up the minivan twice a week just isn't going to cut it ) . we first see young max keeble ( alex d . linz 
 then you'll understand my experience with drowning mona . drowning mona is one of those films that you might hear about and shrug it off as a bad idea . then you'll see a trailer and realize that your first instinct was right . there is no logical reason for you to ever see this movie . it looks unfunny

 there are some interesting scenes 
 there are strange apparitions 
 there are the remains of a spaceship that crashed there -- almost 300 years ago .

 there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant . bunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese 
 there is a series of desperately unfunny scenes 
 there is a suggestion that many characters and scenes were sacrificed on the cutting room floor . veterans jason robards and tracey walter ( who both appeared in demme's philadelphia ) are wasted in small 
 there is absolutely no reason in the world why director frank darabont needed to take three hours and ten minutes out of anyone's life to present this story . in fact

 there is just an assembly-line love triangle 
 there is no attempt to develop their relationship 
 there is no doubt in my mind that the obvious greed to capitalize on the success of last year's film has led everyone down this path 
 there is no emotional involvment with any character in this movie . at one point 
" there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of "" gloria "" was worth remaking or "
 there is no sense of a payoff building . the ending does not go out on a high note with any kind of climax 
 there is no way he can leave the society - except maybe as a drooling vegetable . the premise 
 there is none to speak of . other than some nice photography and two fine performances 
 there is only one scene that is actually scary 
" there is precious little mystery anywhere in "" urban legends "" -- a particularly galling fact given that the film invokes such names as hitchcock and welles . it all comes to a head with the revelation of the killer "
 there is some justification for that by the end of the film . justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending . but serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language 
 there is some manufactured romance within a plot that is so muddled 
 there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting about this movie . the main faults lie with the acting and writing 
 there is the film's attempt at physical comedy . jay's ex-girlfriend natasha ( vanessa angel ) becomes infatuated with jay again once she thinks he is going out with someone else . natasha rips jay's shirt open after pushing him down onto the sofa . as she throws her hair on his bare chest 
 there is the plot . everybody hates mona . mona gets killed . and the question is not who did it 
 there is very little discernible plot . that much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy . it achieves that goal rather admirably

 there isn’t one scene in the movie that has an lighting at all . plus lucy liu’s character 
 there really aren't any ! 
 there richard falls for franoise . this covers about half to two thirds of the movie and aside from the romantic element 
 there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases . the series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 . now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again . for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book 
 there was a moment in the film where dawn goes to new york to find her little sister . she goes to sleep and suddenly wakes up to see a man running down the street with her sister screaming under his arm . i remember thinking at that point that because this film had already lost all integrity 
 there was all that swimming from asia . and 
 there was certainly room for a pretentious and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think they're smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined . cruel intentions is a mess in every possible way 
 there was no one for me to care about or root for . you've got to work pretty hard 
 there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasn't the easiest i am sure . i have to concede that mr . atkinson's acting in this movie is well done . although the role isn't too demanding the slapstick is . i think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue 
 there was not one ounce of subtlety . dawn weiner 
 there were 10 theater movie theaters that were playing this movie around the clock i think that some people really want money badly . . . . and i think that this type of activity hurts the movie industry let the other movies also have a chance . . . . you know any movie with that much play would succeed even if it was the worst movie ever made . . . . . i thought i'd put this here to deflate the movie hype about this flick . . . its not that bad a movie but its not that great either hope you people realize this . 
 there were authors who jumped on the bandwagon for other

 there would be little reason to remain seated until the end of this picture . incidentally 
" there wouldn't be much to "" mystery men "" "
 there's a caption labeling it as such . this wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't for the fact that the caption is right above a sign on the building which reads

 there's a harvard-educated 
 there's a huge one in woo involving a corvette with a broken window that miraculously repairs itself ( added to that is the mystery of how the car looses its top ) . sadly 
 there's a lot of sex and nudity 
 there's a missing disk 
 there's a quick commercial jingle for a burger joint the kids in the film hang out in and a brief rendition of the school song for their high school . nothing great 
 there's a reason they put these kinds of films on late at night : they're just as good as sleeping pills . and this one is one big fat waste of time 
 there's a sordid world of sick and depraved people who won't necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires ? or is it about those who can 
" there's a surprisingly large audience of zealots who dream of screening films with "" spiritual value "" nationwide . and apparently "

 there's a woman named foster ( jamie lee curtis ) out there stopping the computer virus . she's the chief navigator on a sea vessel ; travelling with her is captain everton ( donald sutherland ) 
 there's also something about a ghost possessing the mansion and shit 
 there's also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name ( including `snake eyes' and the notorious bomb `the bonfire of the vanities' ) . . . . all of which makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood . that term may be too harsh 
 there's blood and knives and none of the characters have a lick of common sense . while supposedly doing serious research

 there's no problem . rob schneider plays his sidekick 
 there's no way of altering the fact that snake eyes is a terminal case of style of substance 
 there's none of kubrick's trademark brilliance in this film . 
 there's not a laugh to be found . every attempt at humor -- and there are lots of them -- falls flat with an audible thud . you'd think that out of the dozens of gags jammed into this film

 these special effects are highly effective 
 these sudden developments are supposed to engage our sympathy . at another point 
 these things aren't funny all by themselves . they must be preceded by a clever set-up so the audience hasn 't predicted them five minutes in advance . that's it 
 these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct . unfortunately 
 these two meet eddie murphy 
 these unaccomplished actors just come across as unaccomplished actors . there's not one character you care about when they start shouting for no reason . although what passes for a plot starts out with a solid idea 
 these virtues do not help keep the suspense up . only when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix does the film start moving

 they are each given a rulebook and a key to headquarters . gee 
 they are helped by the best friend who defies orders to help out his buddy ( chi mcbride ) and the supporting female who may or may not become a love interest ( kim dickens ) . why is simon in danger and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player ? apparently 
 they are hundreds and hundreds of people that help contribute and see over a film . the around $8 million budget didn't make any of those hundreds of people make a better film . this is a horrible piece of trash is only occasionally funny because of the amount of risks that it's willing to take for a laugh . in fact 
 they are inferior to such memorable chase sequences as 
 they are like oil and water . one thinks the other is a b * * * * while the other sees her rival as inexperienced and unable to cope with family . caught in the middle of all of this 
 they are not shown as individuals . they are nothing more than potential recipients of over-active 
 they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts 
 they are transported between realities within existenz uncovering more than they initially expected . existenz has all the cronenberg-gore that is expected of him . even so 
 they are ugly little animals who speak their own name for their language ( besides meowth 
" they are what keep the movie afloat . jason biggs right off the flop "" loser "" does an ok job playing silverman "
 they barely have five minutes of screen time 
 they become homicidal . isn't it scary enough that they're like this 
 they begin receiving threats and are eventually attacked by someone who claims to know what they did the previous year . i'm going to keep the rest of this review very short 
 they belong on the afi top 100 list when compared to this degrading trash . aside from unintentionally humoring the audience 
 they bestow max keeble's big move on delighted moviegoers across the country . parents will be thrilled because they'll finally have something to drag little austin and kayla to see that doesn't smell nearly as much like ass as digimon did . don't get me wrong - keeble 
 they both proved that independent filmmakers can make films as cliched as hollywood can . 
 they bring something with them . ross has become a half-human/half-alien hybrid 
 they can be engaging 
 they can hurry back and have sex quickly ) . also 
 they can't save godzilla from being an hugely disappointing and boring movie . the movie goes on for far too long aswell 
 they can't simply put a gun to the back of her head and turn her into dog food -- like a bond movie 
 they claimed 
 they come complete with a subtitle bearing their name and position 
 they commit a violent crime . without fully knowing their motive 
 they could certainly have brought the story down to a less painful length . the plot : an avowedly communist cell named the red may are trying to destabilize japan through acts of terrorism . to combat this threat 
 they could have built a whole new story around it . it turns out one of his men is a traitor 
 they could have come up with a story that at least had a sign of intelligence and freshness . 
 they could honor the time old tradition of knocking over a fruit cart . watch for it in any chase scene set in a foreign country 
 they crash in the forest 
 they decide to create another clone . this creature 
 they decide to pull another pseudo-case of my giant ( 6/10 ) and get semi-serious near the end of the film ( this is where we recognize these people as regular folks like you and i with hearts . ) not one laugh out loud joke here . nothing original to add to anything based in amish folklore . actors are very generic in their roles . avoid this one at all costs 
 they deliver zoot 
 they deserve better material . the vivacious salma hayek is wasted in thankless 
 they develop sil : an innocent-looking 
 they did approve a script in which two small boys are given guns and told to shoot at british people in the woods . the tots are about ten years old 
 they didn't seem to be enjoying themselves . when the film was over 
 they discover it is the last day of the open season 
 they do an excellent job of explaining their profession and exactly what it is they do on a movie set . most documentaries tend to overlook this . doomsday expert hal lindsey is even interviewed ( you'll remember his documentary from the 1970's called the late great planet earth 
 they do battle with a group of homeless pirates ( or something of the sort ) that claude ( wilder again ) and charles ( sutherland again ) are a part of . claude and philippe were separated at birth 
 they do pretty well . sinise is sincere and effective in many of his scenes 
" they do the most intuitive thing possible : place a sample of it in a "" nerds' puzzle magazine . "" of course "
" they don't . we the audience are stuck with ninety minutes of angry one-note characters who rub their quirkiness in our faces . jeff daniels flounders as a pompous hubbie who screams and yells when he doesn't get his way and david schwimmer is grating as a swishy gay stereotype prone to fidgety hissy-fits . robert forster sleepwalks through the standard "" cop ready for retirement "" role who's investigating every other character "
 they don't even belong in b-movies 
 they don't even hesitate to pound each other . wasn't the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friends who could never hurt each other ? by the time the road trip part of the movie is over with 
 they don't want to turn up as the butt of leno and letterman jokes . the movie follows a handful of lives that are affected by the proposition . biebe ( russell crowe ) has just been retired from the team and is asked to coach the boys 
 they dress up as ship's stewards . the over-the-top script has the subtlety of a sledgehammer . when the leads hide from their pursuers 
 they fall in love ( well 
 they find a bag of coffee that says it was produced in rio . they guess that 
 they find poacher paul sarone ( jon voight ) 
 they fish 
 they float along until they fall in love with each other . this uninviting picture 
 they form a mosaic picture of miami beachwalkers and bistro diners . the mosaic is made of sound bites and stereotypes 
 they found him swinging the knife while standing over his parent's corpses . richard dreyfuss is the psychiatrist 
 they gather together a bunch of bazookas and other major weapons 
" they generally resemble poor attempts to imitate clive barker . it's as though the film makers were thinking "" let's see what bizarre/disgusting image we can hurl at them next "" "
 they get lucky and wind up weaselling their way into the ultrahip roxbury as part of the entourage of a tv star ( richard grieco ) . all along the way we get a barrage of hit-and-miss gags -- the best of which have already been played to death in the trailer . it's a little distressing how the movie manages to play host to many different pieces of action without making any of them funny 
 they get turned into cheap arcade-game attacks on the senses . the movie is not interested in reading 
 they get weird pretty quickly 
 they give performances appropriate for the screenplay . tom everett scott ( that thing you do ) plays the lead like he's in a made-for-tv movie . it would be kind to call him bland . actors vince vieluf and phil buckman 
 they go on board to find that the place is seemingly deserted . after turning the power back on 
 they go to great links to get it as well 
" they got idea credit ! i certainly wish that was a new trend in hollywood . . . giving credit for simply having the thought "" say girls "
 they gradually learn about last night's events 
 they guy who looks like harry dean stanton's weaselly brother ) and mom ( loni anderson 
 they harm the story of geronimo . to be honest 
 they have been best friends forever and vow to stay close till the end . while in a bar after doing a show with their band 
 they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks . actually 
 they have to be latex 
 they have to figure a way out of their eternal dilemma . critique : i've been waiting for a good witch movie for a while now 
 they have to kill her * elaborately * 
 they have to make money . the prevailing attitude is that more films equal more profit . some movies obviously exist only to put wares on the screen and to do that 
 they haven't the slightest interest in her . however 
 they indicate the member agrees with the proposal . facing the opposite way means a disagreement . wouldn't they merely express themselves verbally ? hell no . they have to retrieve the paddles for a proper vote 
 they just hang out watching . error . the most interesting character ( and that's not saying much ) is killed off . error . the alien is laughable . error . the rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable . error . there's some nice eyecandy . the face on mars 
 they just scream and drown . why ? this isn't one of those battle scenes that's supposed to disorientate us . it's an incompetently shot beginning to the film's middle section . so 
 they just send him on another assignment 
 they just think they do 
" they killed kenny ! you bastards ! "" ) it's a sick trick "
 they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack ( and he is ) 
" they laugh and roll around while painting each other . there might as well be giant signs flashing : "" feel good now ! "" "" feel bad now ! "" "" patch "" is a good title for the film . it is a patchwork of every manipulative scene you can think of . the full-of-life student fights stodgy establishment types . there's a touching death . then there's another . the film doesn't trust us to get it the first time . the dean tries to kick patch out and later he tries again . worst of all is the final courtroom bit . scary-looking old men sit in judgment of a man who only wants to help people . the room is packed with patch's supporters . williams makes a supposedly impassioned speech about the humanity of all . it has as much emotion as his earlier statement "" humans are the only animal that kills members of its own species "" contains truth . most of the blame must be placed with the director tom shadyac and screenwriter steve oedekerk . shadyac also directed the first "" ace ventura "" movie . oedekerk directed the second one . need i say more ? the real adams is to be admired for his devotion to treating patients as people rather than diseases . the film has a number of worthy messages about the state of the modern medical business with hmos and managed care . the "" doctors are not gods "" theme will resonate with a number of people "
 they least they could do is assume that we'd like to spend our money on a story worth more than ten cents . 
" they look awfully in control : remember the scene with the rubber octopus in "" ed wood "" ? i feel sympathy for mostow "
 they look nice in about a scene and a half . other than that 
 they looked like matte paintings -- the press kit says they filmed in prague and tunisia ! ) and what's up with those gauche costumes 
 they lose them . they get more tickets 
 they lose those too . they come up with crazy schemes to get tickets 
 they make a bunch of clunky 
" they make it trite because each twist involved in their scheme is telegraphed so far in advance through the obvious dialogue that there's no satisfaction in those elements of surprise . the viewer is forced to sit and wait for the inevitable "" moment of shock "" where we see that "" everything is not what it seemed to be . "" a good hour of the movie is devoted to the ogre and his child as they spend time developing their sado-masochistic relationship while alice seethes in the basement demanding food . you quickly become used to the wood ogre pushing luc around "
 they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out -- whenever he isn't muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be . despite his sloshed viewpoint 
 they manage to hear her and move away . in a movie that specializes in cheap shots 
 they may have gone too far . their passengers 
 they meet a hotshot club owner ( chazz palminteri 
 they meet and take hostage the damsel in distress ( suzy amis ) . eventually 
 they meet nadia ( joanna pacula ) who explains their situation : a computer virus has taken over the ship ! it's creating bio-mechanical life-forms to eliminate the human race ! virus is a truly dumb action thriller 
 they might as well be out in some scenic rural location . and 
 they might be the first characters in movie history without a working cerebrum . it would have been funnier if these guys were smart 
 they might have provided some energy to this mess . director adam rifkin knows he hasn't got much material to work with 
 they missed the whole millennial paranoia genre window by about a year . ) enter an occult-expert fbi agent ( jimmy smits ) and you've got a kind of cop-thriller-paranormal sixth sense wannabe that makes apocalyptic pap like end of days look like the seventh seal . while young coleman is a gifted actress 
 they must contend with veteran cop roland castlebeck ( delroy lindo ) 
 they must exhibit at least marginal depth and must also be interesting . rarely can a movie work if it puts an interesting protagonist in the middle and surrounds her with hackneyed 
 they must keep it cool on ice 
 they need to work on characterization and dialogue . 
 they never let up on their sarcastic repartee 
 they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons . kathryn wants sebastian valmont to de-virginize cecile caldwell ( selma blair ) 
 they pay homage to their personal hero and savior - jimmy king ( oliver platt ) 
 they pose as canadian firefighters who somehow got lost across the border . along the way 
 they probably should have completely thrown the script out . that way 
 they proceed to get rid of the body by wiping up the blood and dragging the canvas wrapped body out into the middle of the woods to bury it . ozon dwells on their first major obstacle 
 they prove no help at all except to get in trouble and provide an excuse for chan to jump into his martial arts . in fact 
 they prove that directing is not their strong suit 
 they punish anyone who likes disco 
 they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie should have centered around . zak orth 
 they readily free the scowling ice cube since they need him for protection . it seems a red cloud was released from a shining canyon cave and 
 they realize that something bad must have happened . finally 
 they really _can't_ ) but that their individual personas 
 they risk losing all the money 
 they run into problems when one of their engines is blown 
 they see scary apparitions and people disappear . ever see this movie ? seasoned documentary director joe berlinger should know better . the film features mostly cheap tricks and unnecessary gore . for a storyline filled with surprises 
 they seem alive 
 they set up a protracted 
 they should be lending their talents to some loftier purpose 
 they should have gone all-out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns 
" they should have just given up . "" the show is over for this fella "
" they simply defy description . the movie is infected with the same kind of blunderheaded idiocy and misplaced confidence that made "" last action hero "" ( 1993 ) such a chore to sit through . presumably "
 they solve a sound puzzle and play it to the aliens . the list goes on . the actors are mostly mobile wooden statues . even gary sinise and tim robbins can't muster enough emotion to convince us they are breathing . no one seems to care about anything that happens . you won't either . the absolutely worst sin is the blatant product placement as dr . pepper 
 they start out rather well 
 they start using the dead people to create half-human 
 they started to respect one another . one of jaws' great scenes involved the would-be-ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories . this is the sort of male-bonding foreign to bay or his producer 
 they stick it to her every chance they get . every time sarandon and roberts see each other 
 they stumble across a lodge run by torgo ( the late john reynolds ) 
 they suck in a long worm . like the two dog lovers eating spaghetti in lady and the tramp 
 they sure were nice to look at 
 they take him to brenner's houseboat 
 they team up with a young magician ( zoe mclellan ) who never actually uses her magic -- she's too busy waiting for the boys to rescue her . since jeremy irons only wants to pick up his paycheck for this film 
 they then jump into the middle of a burning forest . when 
 they then travel 
 they thought 
 they throw in a completely un-related plot point . dietl and his partner duke try to solve a case that they have been warned to stay away from . the film spends over half an hour tracking the case of a nun who was beaten and raped to near death . once the case is solved 
 they transport raw sewage . by night ( particularly on nitro' monday ) 
 they turn out to be nothing more than the back story for rather uninteresting adventure story of gatewood and his band . to make even worse 
 they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath . thus begins a chain of events leading up to the inevitable eruption . this film contains a number of cliches . the amorous couple is one . as soon as they doff their clothes 
 they use the cliche of the talking villain 
 they want a better movie 
 they want to nab it from her . oh yeah 
 they want us to know that they exist 
 they were all desperately struggling to stay awake 
 they were not at all interesting or inventive 
 they were wrong . mr . magoo is not just an insult to the blind and near-blind 
 they will all receive black marks on their records for appearing in this dismal movie . graham yost's script serves up one cliche after another for the actors 
 they will be typecast for the rest of their careers 
 they will invest more in the screenplay than the fancy-schmancy visuals . here is one critic crossing his fingers 
 they won't find much meaning in the real blonde 
 they would have realized what leaden results they were producing . it is tricky having good actors play bad ones 
" they'd agree d . c . cab is the quintessential "" usa up all nite "" movie . it's one of those childish r-rated movies that kids would love but can't see until it's edited for tv . it's also one of those pointless "
" they'd all need to star in their own wb television show about the horrors of puberty a la "" dawson's creek . "" needless to say the acting is far from top notch "
 they'd love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibition . on the other hand 
 they'll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them .  oh 
 they'll crash on the island 
 they'll rebound just fine . even after that happens 
 they're . . . inside a goddam pyramid . so they went to egypt 
 they're all black . which 
 they're all here . and 
 they're also supposed to give the storyline a backbone . to do this 
 they're also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe . this revelation exists purely for its own sake . aberdeen doesn't know where else to go . weak 
 they're are quite good . godzilla is an impressive piece of cgi 
" they're as real as life . i once talked to a guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual person's brain with microwaves . then i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections . i even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted . these people had what are known as "" conspiracy theories "" - ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public . a little imagination goes a long way . in richard donner's conspiracy theory "
 they're both . since this description applies to all the characters except sarone 
 they're directed with a degree of competence that assures a level of sustained tension . that's not the case with really bad thrillers like this 
 they're fully clothed . regardless 
 they're good ; so humorous in their inanity that they become hits . i woke up early the day i died 
 they're having a hot affair . the morning after 
 they're in italy in the 1600s . why ? who knows . what are they talking about ? no idea . flashbacks mixed in with the present 
 they're in the film to be laughed at 
 they're intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain 
 they're just action scenes looking desperately for a real story 
 they're kidnapped by a natty old forest hick ( creepy miki manojlovic ) who locks them in the basement . what follows are drawn out scenes of the wood ogre demanding that luc bathe him and have sex with him 
 they're more likely to feel insulted than inspired . the best way to get kids interested in books is to read to them 
" they're out playing in the snow before having sex . the filmmakers attempt to produce a suspenseful plot interspersed with tony and sarah's "" character development . "" someone is out to get poor sarah ( though most of the audience should have figured out who before any of this starts ) . rotting flowers "
 they're still doing the same schitck it hasn't been elevated to another 
 they've been saved by an energetic approach . this casts more than a shadow of a doubt on williamson's ability 
 they've filled out this dvd with extra features . the disc contains the film in its original aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 
 they've got their surfboards 
 they've got to make a living in hollywood . people wanting to see kiss 
 thierry lhermitte director : anthony waller producer : richard claus screenplay : tim burns & tom stern and anthony waller cinematography : egon werdin music : wilbert hirsch u . s . distributor : hollywood pictures an american werewolf in paris is a failed attempt to recapture the humor and horror of john landis' 1981 feature 
 thieves' mazes 
 things are looking up when he meets julia ( drew barrymore ) 
 things are not what they seem 
 things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality . in this category 
 things get out of control and take on cult status 
 things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion . of course 
 things just don't seem to be working out for him ( first life with mikey 
 things start coming together and you begin to get a sense of how this film might have been 
 things they want to do 
" things weren't depressing enough for you mr . screenwriter ? who greenlit this project ? who "" on earth "" thought this would entertain anyone ? perhaps if the film had been structured where kelley perhaps felt some remorse after he caused the destruction of property and nearly killed dozens of people . but even after he's destroyed these people's lives he continues to be a snob to them "
 think dumb all the way through 
 think of the d . i . as what would happen if sgt . joe friday ever enlisted 
 thinking 
 thinking he was dead 
 thinking that they will be a big draw whether or not the film is any good . i think that this must have been what was on the minds of the people who created payback 
 thinks only a miracle can save him . he also falls for kate 
 third in the row 
 third sequel in the series which began with death wish in 1974 . in the original movie 
 third time wasn't the charm and beverly hills iii was failure . eddie murphy had to wait few more years for real comeback . eddie murphy here plays axel foley 
" third-rate script . "" urban legends "" has the feel almost of a serialised drama "
 thirtysomething 
" this amounts to barely more than reciting dialogue of such sheer banality that it makes one eager to see the script randall wallace wrote with his right hand at the same time as he was writing "" pearl harbor "" with his left . the plot here is pure cliche "
 this beast is heading for new york . gulp ! although godzilla should be a non stop roller coaster ride 
 this becomes a second 
 this being an altman-esque intertwined plot 
 this could have been a real success . but the only time the children in the audience seemed excited 
 this could have been the mainstream alternative to michael tolkin's chilling end-of-the-world melodrama 
 this couple is uninteresting . the movie got duller and duller . it became sighing out loud as i kept looking at my watch . even the camera-work was dull . things became laughable when holly took uppers ( this means feel-good drugs 
 this crippled little movie is never healed by faith or anything else . 
 this disappointing film should have been much more powerful 
 this drags on 
 this dream sequence actually did tricked you only because something this ridiculously inept was possible within welcome to the dollhouse . and it is for reasons like this that i think todd solondz did a horrible job as both writer and director . he seemed desperate to shake our views of teenage life--to be an iconoclast--but fell into clichi 
 this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots . shelton's films are not considered sports films 
 this dud's got your standard running 
 this encounter takes place when swamp thing rescues abby from a pair of lecherous moonshiners . barely batting a false eyelash at this living lump of lichen 
" this film "" borrows "" its female lead from basic instinct ) . the best gags "
 this film certainly is what's it's trying not to be . none of the dates myles takes out are all that interesting and as for myles himself 
 this film comes across as little more than a below average 
 this film could have been significantly condensed and had it's running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour 
" this film didn't do much for me . and they might as well have called it the "" haunting of lily taylor "" "
 this film didn't influence too many young computer users out to think they can do what is portrayed in this 105 minute waste of time . 
 this film feels more like an amateurish skit than a real movie . certainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving . they are excuses for gags 
" this film has the criminal "" desolation "" williams . instead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face "
 this film is a complete failure . dollhouse definitely has its moments 
 this film is another case where the trailer is more fun than the movie . i mean 
 this film is bad . the basic story follows three single friends -- jazz ( beyer ) 
 this film is just a series of mastabatory images 
 this film is no-where near his cult classics such as videodrome or scanners . not even half as suspenseful as the commercially successful the fly . existenz can probably be looked upon as his 90's version of videodrome 
 this film is not really a movie 
 this film isn't comedy and any laugh is unintentional . the characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them . the actors that play them don't help either . that is especially the case with jeff fahey 
 this film isn't so bad 
 this film just doesn't even try to do anything original or reasonably entertaining . one cool scene with a boat careening down a mountainside 
 this film might've had a chance to be more than what it is now . which is an unentertaining 
 this film packs more 80s songs in the film than the running time will allow . as a result 
 this film pairs two l . a . policemen - jack colt ( emilio estevez ) 
 this film revels in all the minutiae . and then there's the music . . . learning a lesson from the successful soundtracks to grosse pointe blank 
 this film shows no signs of attempting to avoid campiness ! even the editing seemed to boast a campy quality . i don't know how to explain that one ; it wasn't exactly choppy 
 this film still belongs to action movie genre 
 this flick has all the trimmings of a fourth-year film school final project and just isn't ready for the big screen . barbieri's one probably could have pulled a b + at ucla 
 this gritty film from director marcelo pieyro has its only highlight in a well-designed title sequence . two gay lovers get involved in a bank robbery that makes a gang leader 
 this guy is manipulative ! from that point the film just spins way out of control 
 this has neither . also 
 this has not been a good year . hopefully 
" this horror sequel's moniker also contains a grievous oversight that anyone who saw the original will be able to spot : what "" you "" did _last_ summer "" you "" actually did the summer _before_ last summer "
 this inspired attempt at a sweet story fails on both accounts . it's subject matter and dry storytelling are much to advanced for children 
 this is a bad film -- easily one of the most incompetent films of the year -- but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure . in fact 
 this is a comedy 
 this is a failure . jonathan taylor thomas 
 this is a fantastically bad film ! regardless of what i say about knock off 
 this is a harmless little movie ; it's far from an abomination and it's not torturous to sit through . but bad 
 this is a plot- and idea-driven film and the characters are secondary 
" this is a true story . "" hav tells the camera "
 this is all fine and dandy except for one thing ; instead of spending five minutes trying to bust open the booth 
 this is all-too typical of summer releases . all style and no substance . and there's really not much style . director andrew davis ( the accomplished witness and best-forgotten other films ) has made exactly the wrong choices at almost every turn . douglas and paltrow have both shown us that they are skillful actors in previous films . mortensen showed promise in the past . here all three are walking uninterestingly through their roles with oddly waxen faces . the only person who shows any sense of life is david suchet as new york detective mohamed karaman . he's only on-screen long enough to make you think that there might be a likable person in the film and then he disappears . the first concern of a suspense film is to create suspense . surprises are important . in this movie the audience keeps waiting for something to happen . and nothing ever does . nearly every event is telegraphed in advance . close-up on this object or that action and it's easy to guess what's going to happen . as the film plods towards its inevitable conclusion you keep expecting a plot twist to make the movie worthwhile . it's a hopeless quest . the story doesn't make much sense . steven's wife is loaded . even with unfriendly relations 
 this is an action film and not-disappointingly it ends with action . unfortunately 
 this is definitely a guy movie . so 
 this is devastating . we wouldn't know this because she never talked about having kids before 
" this is indeed the 'final cut' for the "" urban legend "" mini-franchise . copyright  2000 shannon patrick sullivan . archived at the popcorn gallery "
" this is it ! "" philips warns . what he finds in the basement of an old "
 this is just a sham - corrupt official cliff vandercave ( kyle maclachlan ) and his sultry secretary sharon stone ( halle berry ) need a scapegoat for their embezzlement scheme . in the meantime 
 this is just another bad sequel . it's about on the level of this year's batman & robin 
 this is just another rarely entertaining formula killathon 
 this is just plain bad material ( that doesn't deserve this long of a review ) and for that i give it a paltry  stars . 
 this is largely just used as an irrelevant backdrop while the killings are carried out in typical slasher style . there is a startling dearth of imagination here : even the deaths 
 this is most worrying . young director gary fleder scored a hit a few years back with his quirky pulp fiction-esque things to do in denver when your dead . but what can he do with material as resolutely mediocre as this ? not much 
 this is my excuse : it was prom night 
 this is negated by the fact that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film 
" this is not a documentary on those of us after we first saw the "" cryin' "" video . this is one of those erotic thrillers "
 this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . . it's just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids . it also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since . whatever . . . skip it ! where's joblo coming from ? a nightmare of elm street 3 ( 7/10 ) - blair witch 2 ( 7/10 ) - the crow ( 9/10 ) - the crow : salvation ( 4/10 ) - lost highway ( 10/10 ) - memento ( 10/10 ) - the others ( 9/10 ) - stir of echoes ( 8/10 ) 
 this is not a well-written motion picture . firestorm is a collection of howlingly bad lines set against a backdrop of disaster movie clichs which 
 this is not an exit : the fictional world of bret easton ellis . fox tries to pull off the imaginative conceit of crossing interview footage of ellis with dramatizations from his body of work 
 this is not exactly a great flick . in fact 
 this is not one of them . two points in the movie's favour - the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati and occasionally evocative score by fabio frizzi - keep things from falling totally into the abyss 
 this is one-hundred percent correct . the plot 
 this is pretty much a made-for-tv movie with more ( and bigger ) explosions and more foul language . in fact 
 this is still trash 
 this is supposed to come on as real drama . let me make this review shorter for you : if you enjoy inflicting pain on yourself 
 this is the case for about the first half of the movie then things begin to settle into what might truly be considered absent minded . along the way to becoming absent minded from absent of mind the professor stumbles onto flubber . thankfully or there would be no movie or any amusement for the audience . the flubber is supposed to be flying rubber 
 this is the only realistic element in the film ) . much of the writing is simply bad 
 this is the point where the movie strays from becoming a decent and original movie and simply becomes a predictable sci-fi thriller . anyhow

" this is the stuff of nightmares whether we are asleep or awake . this is exactly how you will feel 15 minutes after "" battlefield earth "" begins . for all of its flash and style "

" this is what you come away with from the characters : they bob their heads to "" what is love ? "" "
 this isn't enough . we've all seen enough cop shows and drug-lord revenge thrillers . gussying yet another one up in the guise of sf doesn't help anyone . footnote : the strangest thing about alien nation is the tv series that was spun off from it

 this line not only gives foreshadowing to the opening sequence 
 this marketing technique will probably succeed and result in

 this might not be your cup of tea . knock off sucks . it stoops to ridiculous levels that most individuals could only conjure up in horrific nightmares . it amazes me how far these producers will go to sell something 
 this movie 
 this movie . and the funny thing is 
 this movie barely squeezes any sense out of its clich-ridden plot 
 this movie contains very few moments of magic . . . or humor for that matter 
 this movie could be recommended only to the most fanatical charles bronson fans or for the people who are already desperate for 1980s nostalgia . ( special note for trekkies : marina sirtis 
 this movie did offer some true and realistic performances by its cast 
 this movie features some decent acting 
 this movie has a performance at a country fair 
 this movie has no point . so just in case your best judgment has left you and you find yourself standing at the ticket booth . maybe everything else is sold out . maybe you feel a sudden compulsion to experience the entire oeuvre of bette midler . maybe you're just not thinking . please 
 this movie is a hodge-podge of action scenes and flashy sets and costumes while trying to show off a plot at the same time . does it work ? sort of . . . the plot involves the evil shadowloo organization run by m . bison ( raul julia ) . guile ( jean claude van-damme ) takes his troops to attack bison's main base in an attempt to liberate the innocent villages he has taken over . in a short amount of time 
 this movie is an embarrassment to the entire action genre of modern filmmaking . and considering how low hollywood has stooped as of late in that department 
 this movie just might do . but if it's tomb raider you really want 
 this movie sucks because it is unfunny 
 this movie thuddingly hits the same numb point over and over again : guns are bad 
 this movie wasn't the horror show that some of the early reviews had warned us about 
 this movie's purpose is to head towards a goal that shouldn't even exist . it's a ten minute short film with ninety-five minutes of filler . if you were to show me sleepless in seattle and i didn't have to review it 
 this nearly-inconsequential success is no substitute for the weak script and unfunny execution . the special effects 
 this one 
 this one has sequences that are inappropriately 
 this one is a big 
 this one is a lost cause . i'm trying to think of one redeemable quality in this film 
" this one is filled with decent inmates who all happen to be "" misunderstood "" "
 this one is intended to be more of a thematic successor . its events are inspired by the original 
 this one is remarkably tame for the man who became famous when he made carrie . the movie's outline has some promise 
 this one is set on a national holiday - the fourth of july . christmas and graduation day are also popular 
" this one opens with a fast-paced space battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene in the film ( probably because it has "" star wars "" written all over it ) "
" this one suffers from overkill . so much is overdone in "" stigmata "
 this one tries to be funny and fails 
 this one would have a deadpan expression . in a series of off-the-wall crises 
 this one's obvious at about the 30-minute point . i believe that the filmmakers realized this 
 this opens the gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or the dead will rise and walk the earth . the medium apparently dies of fright during the seance 
 this outta-nowhere character is so devoid of 
 this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient plot device . those expecting to see even a semi-thorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed . mercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism . the script for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome and hard- to-swallow . i don't know whether the problem is in the original book 
 this particular band of criminals happens to be the dumbest the world can offer . why else would they indulge in petty squabbling while they watch their friends become fish food . if there's a more clarion call for unity 
 this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense . the story begins with a formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold 
 this peculiar film follows him as we learn a little about his decidedly unstable life . his father ( stephen rea ) is an indifferent alcoholic 
 this picture will force producers to think harder about which subjects have promise and which do not . mr . magoo runs 1 : 37 . it is rated pg for comic violence and would be acceptable for all ages . my son jeffrey 
 this professionalism can't help the fact that the script and characters are trash . big daddy is for die hard fans of sandler 
 this scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake before a quarter of the movie had even passed . in films like these 
 this scene was pulled off in the worst way possible because it suffered severely from clichi-itis . brandon's character steps up to the fence 
 this sensitive coming of age tale comes from bobby and peter farrelly 
 this should have been called watchers v 
 this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed 
 this surreal triumph of suspenseful style over substance is packaged as a puzzle with several of the key pieces left out . 
 this theme has become one big clich . here the devil looks more like a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental institution . he is walking around n . y . 
 this time 
 this time around 
 this time between the childish sillyness of the good guys and business-like professionalism of the bad guys . since foley belongs to the former 
 this time in the role of protagonist 
 this time it's on an island in the bahamas where the lush surroundings are just bound to turn deadly . in the middle of summertime 
 this time played by an oscar-winner to give the movie some more clout - michael caine . it seems that caine wants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land . around the 20-30 minute point 
 this time to examine frankie . she has been seen reacting to hallucinations and displaying signs of stigmata 
 this turns the movie into a carnival freakshow 
 this version gives us a creepy haunted house and four hapless people to populate it . chief among them is eleanor ( taylor ) 
 this wasn't a very wise move on the part of the screenwriters - the infamous dr . claw has been turned into a wisecracking game show host who makes cheap attempts at being suave and cool . he does still have his cat 
 this will be a flick that can become addictive . it will hit you on more levels than most three other movies . it's a romp--the sort of thing lots of us wanted to do as kids--screw everything 
 this would be the result 
 this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour . there are a few things that keep cool does right . as mentioned before 
 this would serve as a metaphor for the rest of the picture

 water starts leaking through

 way too complex at its climax . but reindeer games makes its first serious mistake during the first half an hour . the hero commits a greedy 
" way too many plot "" twists "
 wayans is bringing it on himself -- he's clearly set up as the white man's burden and is handled as such . his final scene nails the coffin shut on my case . ridley and snails sneak into the inner sanctum of a wizard who has some sort of secret scroll ( another prop ) that the bad guys are after . as the good guys set off on their adventure 
 wayne-and-garth antics 
 we already saw that the computer virus has taken over the ship and eliminated everyone on board . the evil captain everton thinks he's going to take the ship in and get a reward ; he convinces his crew that there's going to be big money 
 we are all of 10 seconds in and i have a zillion questions racing through my mind . when were we conquered ? the audience is led to believe that this happened about 1 
" we are both not to trusted . "" after their wedding "
 we are expected to exhibit compassion and courtesy toward the sisters as they join for a melodramatic finale . we are able to identify with eve ( ryan ) 
 we are given a shot of libby staring and crying at his picture . in an action movie like this

 we are left with a lot of digital effects and mark wahlberg

 we are witness to the big snake winning a showdown with a panther . the anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were a stuffed animal and squeezes it so hard 
 we are witnessing the deluge of films based on old 
 we aren't quite positive . i'd love to say that this movie will entertain you in some fashion 
 we as an audience must experience that feeling along with them . to show us the monster early on is to let us in on something the characters don't know about 
 we can be sure that i hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies 
 we can fill in the blanks with our own warm feelings of home . the two other problems involve the beginning and the ending . i just don't believe that a great wise leader would have so immaturely handled such a delicate situation as depriving the thrown from his immoral son . caesar would have ordered his son commodus off on some important mission in some distant land or other 
 we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out his cleaver and exact his revenge . unfortunately 
" we can only assume that that's how lucy supports her habit and procures her living expenses . a typical scene has the editors arguing about whether a potential photographer's work is transcendental or merely classical . that no one has a clue as to the dogma they are spouting becomes obvious but not particularly funny . "" your work has a cultural currency that is important now "
 we can thumb the fast-forward and make up for costner's hamhandedness in the director's chair . monty python once had a recurring character they named d . p . gumby 
 we can't really tell or care . the screenplay 
 we cut to luc goddard ( don cheadle ) and his team 
 we do not see ! james garner is the only one not having sex . and gene hackman is the only person who hasn't shot anyone ! if this sounds like a piece of filth 
 we don't 
 we don't care . better to leave them unshown . crowe is a great actor 
 we don't care anyway . i probably shouldn't mention that this was directed by david nutter 
 we don't even get to hear them talk . there are some good aspects of the film 
 we don't expect the humour to hammer us over the head like a baseball bat . 
 we don't know their names 
 we don't really care . there are three problems in the hi-lo country . one 
 we don't really care what happens to them . well

 we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong-perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it ; i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes . whether or not they save the day 
 we finally have an sf flick this summer that's worse ( * much * * much * worse ) than star trek v ( makes stv look like academy award material 
 we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past 
 we follow the trials and tribulations of two would-be couples - one young 
 we get an original vision or an offbeat story to begin with 
 we get it . . . there are people chasing her and we don't know who they are . do we really need to see it over and over again ? how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ? apparently 
 we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another 
 we get the worst werewolf sequel since the howling ii : your sister is a werewolf . ( i will give waller credit for killing off a dog 
 we get to see angelina jolie's breasts again ) 
 we get to see brennan get in his car and drive off 
 we go through ten minutes of preview and finally the movie we've been waiting to see for a long time comes on . we sit there 
 we had some movies that had better cgi effects back in 1992 
 we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson 
 we have . but then again 
" we have a movie that just doesn't deliver . "" gone in 60 seconds "" feels like it can barely get out of neutral "
 we have a storyline that borders on idiotic ( and 
" we have another case of "" the idiot plot "
 we have been hoodwinked . bamboozled ( mixed rating ) : a greenlight rating for what visionary spike lee * tried * to say ; but . . . . . . a cautionary yellowlight for the way director spike lee said it . spike 
 we have charlie ( burns ) 
 we have disinterested actors who sleepwalk through the roles of his white enemies . while this could be expected from someone like jason patric 
 we have taken up this entire planet 
 we have the prison warden subplot . the prison warden is evil and wants to stop caulder's progress at any cost ; if this means taking caulder off the powell case 
 we have the typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else 
 we haven't seen that in a movie before . ) arnold the absentee father becomes convinced that the only way to buy back his son's affection is to get him a turboman doll 
 we hear a ponderous voice-over throwing out strange names and places . we haven't been introduced to anyone yet 
 we hold out hope that we can at least expect some spectacular sequences of dumb action . but there is hardly any fighting until the climax 
 we join the team during their final days aboard the ship . what happened during the five months prior to this ? did they just play cards and tell dirty jokes ? still 
 we know better ) . the result is not a reliving of the cuban missile crisis : it's a sickening exploitation of a historical event . don't believe me ? go to the movie's web site ( see below ) and check out the strategic military exercise 
 we know from the beginning that woo and tim are going to end up together . the question is 
 we know his plan is going to fail . how do we know this ? because we've seen the tv ads for deep impact 
 we know that isn't the way it happened happen because we saw an evil 
 we know that she is 
 we know that sooner or later something bad is going to happen to the people kersey cares for . this time karen's teenage daughter dies of a crack overdose and kersey is forced to return to his old vigilante ways . kersey's new targets

" we learn that abby has a very special relationship with plants . not only does she call her succulents down-to-earth names like "" jimmy "" and "" mary "
 we learn that she has gone to great lengths to secure a fake passport for her son . twenty minutes into the film 
" we meet barry pepper's ( "" saving private ryan "" ) character "
 we might advance beyond our solar system and into the next one . but the human race doesn't have much to worry about . after all 
 we might just accept it 
 we movie critics have been thinking the same thing for years . when the two apes present the idea before a judicial counsel ( the head ape being shakespearean actor maurice evans ) 
 we narrowly dodge a remake of green card 
 we never really become too familiar with these characters 
 we now can have films show off special effects without being at all entertaining . flubber is anthropomorphized into a being supposedly with personality . the gloop has little arms and legs and splits into tiny little gloopettes for a big dance number . this has nothing to do with the story . the only possible reason is to create merchandising opportunities so that kids can badger their parents into taking them to mcdonalds for the toys . not that contributing little to the plot is a big problem . there are very few aspects of the film that move the story and those that do don't make sense . the discovery of flubber is going to save the college because brainard can sell his flying car to ford . anyone with half a brain would be able to see that his intelligent flying automaton is worth billions . it's unbelievable that his lover ( well 
 we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction 
 we pluck this flower 
" we present a unique experience for filmcritic . com -- something of a "" he said "

 we was taken full throttle into the splendor that is memphis . he's first shown living the good life teaching young children to drive go-carts . in a later scene 
 we webb anti-fans still have the d . i . 
" we went to see -- what else -- hard rain . "" so "
 we were actually supposed to sympathize with him . this is definately not young owens fault 
 we were left with a long-winded ending that did little to answer any other questions i might've still had 
 we were really pissed off about this . admittedly 
 we were subjected to home alone 2 
 we were subjected to nearly every conceivable combination of relationships-from-hell ! there were boyfriends from hell 
 we witness an orgasmically happy francis in the audience . in a film that tries obsessively to shock 
 we would have had a thirty-minute movie far superior to the two-hour one that i watched today . if the central idea had been developed beyond the old man tarzan premise 
 we'll just call him nick 
 we'll make her a feisty magazine editor 
 we're all jealous of jack webb's way with women

 we're never given a reason to believe why this would make him an assassin . not when we find out about his salinger collection 
 we're supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group of buffoonish aliens who can't even handle a few cavemen ? one of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos . so jets left unattended for 1

 we're treated to phony bluescreens

 were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills ? none of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered ( whenever that was ) . this is definitely not the way to start an action/sci-fi film . one of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster

 with no beginning and no end . this behavior has of course estranged her from her only sister and from life itself . her existence is filled with endless parties and comic episodes . such as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper ( dominic west )

 with scenes of him bullying crooks around 
 with seriously wicked eyes and just enough ham in his performance to go with all of the cheese lying around . the little girl is also pretty good but unfortunately her character doesn't really do all that much . and believe it or not 
 with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences . it's not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious 
 with shows like pyromaniacs caught on tape and buxom blondes and their hotels airing on network television nightly . alternative and hard rock bands are ranking high on the charts replacing all of the regular sugar choked pop that normally reigns supreme . but what about one of the most outrageous bands of all time ? kiss

 with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi . this guy was really likable 
" with the exception of jessica cauffiel ( last seen destroying her boyfriend's car in "" road trip "" ) . jessica does a great job playing a girl who can't act . take that in whatever context you'd like . much as i'd like to blame john ottman for this movie i can't . why do i want to blame him ? well "

 you will likely enjoy this film as well . they both start off with interesting premises 
 you will most likely be filled with questions 
 you will not care . beatty is more concerned with presenting his story too quickly and as you figure out that his film lacks depth and insight 
 you will realize that it lacks a single original scene . it's a direct rip-off of nearly every james cameron film ( aliens 
 you won't . 
 you won't care anyway ) she is suddenly made into a complex character with feelings that we are all supposed to grieve for . this isn't to mention the fact over overwhelming cheese . whereas in dead men don't wear plaid ( yes that was a comedy but i'm on a roll here ) the cheese was used effectively and the actors were aware of it 
" you won't care much about the "" plot "" in this film . . . critique : parody movies either work or they don't and this one just doesn't work ! the laughs aren't as pronounced this time around "
 you won't waste your time renting this muck . 
 you wonder how he recognized him so fast . the worst part is the little past they try to give declan 
 you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for a guy like darnell period 
 you wonder why they just don't get the hell out of there . i think what happens to gavin is proof enough that there's something rotten in the state of teen angstdom . what this film needs to be is a lot longer

 you'd think he'd have enough common sense to think it would backfire on him one day

 you'd think that they would have been able to work together to fix the noticably large flaws 
 you'd think they could have made these sharks look mildly realistic . i'm afraid not folks . these look like something out of an old '50s movie 
 you'll be amazed at what little foundation is built around the the rest of the story . beatty directs and is the co-author of 'bulworth' and for a man who has been a part of classics like 'bonnie and clyde' 
 you'll be bored out of your skull . much of this film seems nothing more than aykroyd's self-serving vanity project 
 you'll be left with exactly the same .

 you'll find it incredibly stupid ( even for a schwartzenegger movie ! ) . the incredible fact is that such directors never learn . after thousands of headless productions 
 you'll find that it is not being suppressed by the church ( as the film seems to claim )

" you'll most likely realize that none of the names sound familiar . that's because each cast member sealed his/her acting fate by appearing in this "" movie "" . not one actor involved went on to make any other picture . could appearing in a bad movie really do this to one's career ? it's doubtful . for example "

capsule : gal is a 50s-ish london cockney gangster who has retired to spain . his old associates want him for one last job and send the vicious don to give him an offer he can't refuse . a standout performance by ben kingsley as don cannot save what is essentially a set of cliches recycled from old westerns . rating : 4 ( 0 to 10 ) 
capsule : in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace . there is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise . john carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films 
capsule : irredeemably stupid and pigheaded attempt at a story about the first female navy seal . read rogue warrior instead . demi moore has never been terribly compelling 
capsule : repugnant 
capsule : the much anticipated re-adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting 
capsule : the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smith's films gets their own movie . the gags are sporadically funny . it is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and anti-gay jokes . the plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team . the little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film . sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching . this feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night . ( and it turns out he had very good reasons . ) rating : 4 ( 0 to 10 ) 
capsule : this super-light situation comedy from sweden tells the story of two close friends with romantic problems . the script involves formerly taboo subjects like erotic toys and sexual enhancers but otherwise the writing is not a lot different from what is shown free on television . the characters are paper-thin and the interesting ideas purely non-existent . this is a decrement-life-by-90-minutes card . rating : 4 ( 0 to 10 ) 
capsule : tired and thin attempt at genre-mixing : aliens are among us meets crime story . cliches abound . alien nation starts with one great idea and then drowns it in an ocean of stupidity . it starts off with a none-too-thinly disguised allegory about -- literally -- legal and illegal aliens . a spaceship comes to earth 
capsule : trashy 
capsule : why is this movie three hours long ? because it's too stupid to know when to stop . the postman may be the single dumbest movie i've ever seen . not the worst -- i still leave that accolade to be divided between starship troopers and money train -- but by far the dumbest . it takes a situation that had plenty of possibilities

i admit it . i thought arnold schwarzenegger had a knack for comedy when he made twins and true lies . watching him in jingle all the way 
i challenge any film reviewer to find an animated film that is more sickeningly bad 
i have little against remakes and updates of older films and tv series . if there's a will 
i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard . the problem is 
i missed a 1 oclock for stir of echoes by six minutes and

in brief : i think your response to the good son will depend on your response to the question of evil . i found the film excellent--and disturbing . i was uncomfortable throughout . it focuses on one thing--evil--and tries to look at it on its own terms

it is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch . based on the late 1960's television show by the same name 
it is rare that a great actress ( garofalo ) will make two * really * bad movies 
it seems that david lynch's adaptation of frank herbert's epic science fiction novel dune ( 1984 ) wasn't enough to convince people that this classic works far better on the page . at least that box office fiasco packs in some interesting lynchian perversions . besides 
it would be easy to miss the point of a film like 'hurlyburly' . that is if it had one . i've been a movie critic for 15 years and i don't think i've ever seen a more pointless film that rambles on and on and on like a broken record and when it's over 
it's hard to approach the good and bad in this film without being caught up a discussion of the message of bosna !

scheduled to open on december 20th is the comedy/drama 'one fine day' starring michelle pfeiffer and george clooney . i had the opportunity to view this movie in advance on the evening of december 5th here in my hometown through various established contacts and i can tell you right now that there's no need to hold your breath . the movie is set in new york city and pfeiffer and clooney star as the parents of kindergarten aged children who arrive one morning escorting their offspring to school and they are late and the class has already left for their scheduled field trip . she is an architect on the verge of a major promotion within her company and he is a high profile journalist working on the most important story of his life . they are forced to juggle the needs of their children and their careers and are inadvertently thrown together for one fine day of course meaning it will be one of the most chaotic and alarming days in memory as they must bring small children to work with them ! unfortunately you can't build a film with a running time of 108 minutes simply around a premise . the premise must expand into plot and develop gears to get off the ground . this film never does that and i looked at my watch at precisely the 24 minute mark which is a bad sign . clooney

silent fall has the shreds and shards of a far better movie lurking around inside it somewhere . it takes the form of a psychological thriller 
simply irresistible reviewed by jamie peckrating :  20th century fox / 1 : 36 / 1999 / pg-13 ( language 
simply irresistible tries really hard to recapture the feel of an old- fashioned romantic fantasy . in fact 
"so ask yourself what "" 8mm "" ( "" eight millimeter "" ) is really all about . is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy "
some concepts seem patently hopeless from the beginning 
some houses should never be visited . and some movies should never be remade . the haunting represents both of those tenets . a loose remake of the 1963 haunting

some movies ask you to leave your brain at the door 
some talented actresses are blessed with a demonstrated wide acting range while others 
sometimes a stellar cast can compensate for a lot of things 
species is a forehead-knockingly bad movie . you know what i'm talking about : that's when you sit there

the marketers of hudson hawk obviously have a lot more talent than the filmmakers . misguided and miscalculated on every conceivable level 
the marvelous british actor derek jacobi stars in writer and director john maybury's love is the devil about the popular modern artist francis bacon . as always

the outrageous antics of comedian rodney dangerfield are seen in such hilarious films as 'caddyshack' ( 1980 ) 
the pagemaster is the oddest film aimed at children i've ever seen . it makes a number of gigantic errors in judgment -- not the least of which is that it has the unsubtle subtext of reading as being a chore to be risen to . it's a depressing and blatantly manipulative movie at its heart 
the premise of turbulence is i'm sure very familiar to us all . we've seen it before in passenger 57

well if you are up for stellar effects then this is the movie for you . because thats all that there really is . . . . i found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in the plot . for one thing
