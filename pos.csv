" a film aptly described by critic scott renshaw as "" a southern spin on fargo "
 a film comes along with the kind of energetic filmmaking that matches the intensity of its characters it hopes to depict . trainspotting is that shooting star that burns across a sky littered with static constellations . dom is a part-time filmmaker who graduated from northwestern university's radio/tv/film programme not too long ago . he has laboured on various music videos and short films in and around campus and chicago . nowhere town 
 a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on . both the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations ( down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses ) but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout . the movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in bateman's impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does . as a result 
 a film in which the actors 
 a film maker whose politics have always been left of centre and whose long career has been driven by his very personal choice of projects . in this cynical and scathing political satire beatty tackles many of the more obvious problems of the american democratic process 
 a film of scruffy beauty and spellbinding power 
" a film still catches me by surprise . "" spy kids "" certainly did . an adventure story aimed primarily at children "
 a film that addresses patterns 
 a film that covers the fortunes of a jewish hungarian family under the reigns of three different regimes 
 a film that gets you right into the streets 
 a film this goofy should have inspired nothing more than simple indifference 
 a film which became a huge hit and launched the teen slasher genre 
 a film which shares quite a number of conventions with many of the b-level 
 a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters . this is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth . rounders

 a first class passenger 
 a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states . she's working for gun dealer ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) 
 a foppish hybrid of willy wonka and pee wee herman who hosts juni's favorite tv show . but there is evil behind the scenes

 a gas company employee ( david cronenberg ) calls every customer letting them know the gas will be flowing until the very end and thanks them for their business 
 a general who leads the romans to victory against the german tribes to the north . contradicting real life 
 a genre which is probably the least respected of them all . the river wild was one of the best action/suspense films i have seen from the 90s . the intelligence of the screenplay 
 a gentle fellow with a great beard 
 a german production 
 a girl in his biology class 
 a girlfriend who he doesn't care for 
 a good 
 a good film 
 a good idea stretched way beyond its limits . the script degrades with too many plot twists 
" a good indication as to what kind of film to expect here . this ain't your average "" happy go lucky "" kind of picture . this is a deliberately slow-paced mystery-horror film drenched in atmosphere "
 a good mastering job has been performed on the film itself . the original elements are not in the best condition--non-studio silents were unlucky in their preservation-- so we're still dealing with a slightly washed out 
 a good movie comes through . dicaprio is marvelous as the young 
 a good movie loaded with great features at a reasonable cost . the di$ney people could learn a lot from columbia tristar . reviewed by chuck dowling - chuckd21@fdn . com the jacksonville film journal - http : //www . jaxfilmjournal . com/ 
 a goofy masseuse 
 a goulash joint - these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots . except for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city

" a great amount of love or hate is attached to each character . "" the green mile "" is so good following the rough beginning "

 a highly clouded figure named jun tao . at least it's entertaining 
 a hilarious and quirky dark comedy that opened 1999's sundance film festival . first time writer anne rapp wrote this kinda-sorta murder mystery that slightly echoes the coen brothers' fargo and david dobkin's clay pigeons . what is kind of ironic about cookie's fortune is that 15 minutes into the movie

 again overlaps with ronna's story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle . we're shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna . and many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam aren't even their fault - they just happened to be where they were when they were . i'd really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end

 alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy . 
 alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects 
 alda keeps ringwald's screen time to a minimum ; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters . the wedding is just a device to bring together the bride's working-class

 all but one of them somewhat reluctant 
 all combine to make one spectacular film . whatever you do 
 all dress in matching secret servicewear ; the rebel fighters

 all hand-delivered by couriers within an hour . designed in 1997 by two college roommates -- joseph parks

" all in the name of the "" greater good .

 all of the telephones are old-fashioned 
 all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities 
 all of them residing in a southern town called holly springs . first we meet willie ( charles s . dutton ) 
 all of this can be pretty hilarious 
 all of this would add up to little more than an above-average light show 
" all of which helped raise her character several levels above the "" typical "" bitchie girlfriend that we've seen in many of these relationship movies . but that's the thing that i liked the most about this movie . everyone seemed real "
 all of which mccormack easily transmits with a single flash of her eyes . the rest of the roles are also filled well 
 all of which subtly add to a vague sense of discomfort whenever oscar is on-screen . as good as fiennes is

 all over the place 
 all perform well within their limits . the only presence that demands real attention when placed next to martin or murphy is the beautiful heather graham 
 all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man . the film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act . it concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit . we learn only a little about mike 
 all right 
 all saucy 
 all shot in the 2 . 35 : 1 cinemascope aspect ratio ( the first animated feature to be shot so since 1959's sleeping beauty ) 
" all that matters in deciding whether or not "" scary movie "" is any good are the laughs . and "" scary movie "" is the first parody i've seen in years that has laughs in droves . but fair warning first : i'm a big fan of the "" naked gun "" movies . i enjoyed "" spaceballs "" . if your sense of humor runs contrary to my own "
 all that we wish for them both is to be happy 
 all the characters have gotten exactly what they wanted out of life . there are no real conflicts 
 all the rest join in . did michael bay attend the school of sappy filmmaking before he made this picture ? but naturally 
 all the time . malcolm assumes 
 all the way to an ambulance-chasing lawyer ( bill murray ) 
 all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid . the effects that don't look totally real are still a pleasure to behold 
 all the while backpedaling his way out of their relationship . he then flees the scene with the grace of an inept thief . erin's mother ( holland taylor 
 all the while creating for witty 
 all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation 
 all the while proving why none of them were strippers in the first place . as if there anti-appeal wasn't enough

 all things considered 
 all this has made of wilde a patron saint of gay artists . among the many cinema genres 
 all this sappiness 
" all three endings were included on one tape . . . the first two endings being "" what if ?

 all three shifts seem the same . whoever's in the ambulance with you 
 all to give the audience the pleasure they seek : morally reprehensible yet hilarious sexual humor . the production is also big where it counts : in the heart . this gigolo is well worth the $8 price of entry . deuce bigalow ( rob schneider ) has mastered his trait to a point where he swims with the fishes- literally . a knowledgeable yet sexually deprived fish tank cleaner 
 all to the background of the local disco . whit stillman has both written and directed an interesting and believable story . alice and charlotte are both well written characters 
 all two reviews )

 allowed him even some internal battles - between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own anti-violent philosophy . the latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lee's acting skills and some new elements to his impressive screen presence . although two other main actors - john saxon being the obligatory good white guy and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy - were intended to share top spot with lee 
 allowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed 
 allowing for semi-brainless relaxation 
 allowing the trees all around to come to life vividly . i couldn't believe my eyes- disney has come a long way since starting in a ballroom for beauty and the beast . and the music's not half bad 
 allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others 
 allowing viewers to think for themselves about the meaning . and director vincent ward puts it all together into his final vision . what dreams may come is a good example of german expressionism which may just turn off a good portion of the audience . your average movie goer more than likely isn't used to expressionistic techniques . the film will also definitely draw attention from religious people 
 allowing you to watch any of the three endings by themselves . ) now while i applaud the effort of paramount here

 although his accent does stray a little . emma thompson delivers a strong performance as his suffering wife who can't let anything show that might hurt the presidential run . the problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of their audience by promoting one side or the other 
 although his accent is a problem 
 although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick . sadly 
 although his style is much more restrained here . however 
 although his unsympathetic choice of role here may come as something of a surprise to many of his fans . the performances of the supporting cast are solid

 although that has come at a high price . mox believes that there is life beyond football 
 although the characters really are underwritten . the standout in my opinion is liam neeson 
 although the ending has its weaknesses 
 although the film deals his character a cheap blow at the end by having him improbably join the inquisition and turn into the bad guy . platt is a good actor 
 although the performances overcome many of the limitations of the formulaic and predictable script . an always likeable and solid actor 
 although the rest of the film is terrific . all in all 
 although the setting is contemporary 
 although the true bright spots are the supporting roles . laura dern ( jurassic park ) lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher 
 although their love is doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex . but she continues to act because she loves shakespeare's writing so much 
 although there is some interaction between the different twosomes 
 although there isn't much bloodshed or gore in the movie . editing is superb 
 although they are not particularly ashamed of it . perfect for viewers who can appreciate perverse comedy 
 although they do not detract from the more human elements of the story . younger audiences may find themselves a little bored with the developing romance between o'hara and jill 
 although they mostly lack gore associated with that genre . in many way they are also more realistic ( they were personally staged by lee himself ) 
 although this does not affect the film that greatly . and finally 
 although tommy lee jones opens up his comedic personality in this film . the special effects are also very well done and are not the entire source of the plot

 an entertaining but wildy over-rated and equally mediocre film . ) both films are esentially entertainments that could have been alot better then they are . as seen on a big screen rotj is great fun . ( if i had reviewed it after seeing it on the big screen i would have gave it  and b + . ) but i'm talking little screen here - the video experience . and that ain't all that great . i still like the film - but i don't love it . i'm starting to worry that mr . lucas will not live up to our expectations when he releases his new films . perhaps there is no way he can . ( of course such a rule can be defied . i've never like jurassic park but i thought the sequel was well crafted and a heck of alot of fun . ) but whether or not he does tesb is a movie to treasure and the other two aren't all that bad either .

 and a compass . 
 and a couple of other local illegal activities result in a frantic circle of destruction . though the web of illegal activity is obviously reminiscent of pulp fiction 
 and a cultural influence 
 and a deadly buzzsaw . none of the action sequences in mr . nice guy are as spectacular as supercop's thrilling helicopter-train finale or rumble in the bronx's daring leap between two buildings ; nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor 
 and a ditty headed by rem's michael stipe 
 and a drug addiction . when yasuda shoots him ( it isn't much of a wound 
 and a exciting chariot chase 
 and a fair amount of humor that caters to adults as well as children . the little mermaid is worth a big-screen ticket in 1997 
 and a ferrari in the garage are ample compensation for whatever he may be missing in the way of mediocre suburban living . but when this good-natured wall street mega-titan puts his life on the line to save a convenience store from a firefight 
 and a few others . everybody in this movie is brilliant 
" and a few particularly hilarious scenes . little known facts : the farrellys big break came when they somehow got a copy of their script "" dust to dust "" into the hands of eddie murphy via murphy's neighbour . they only found out about murphy's interest "
 and a few sentimental moments all mixed in to one great little movie . stuart little is a mouse . he has finally gotten a new home after being put up for adoption 
 and a few star trek episodes ( both classic and next generation ) . what is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thought-provoking . keanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo 
 and a film with such a theme lives and dies on the conviction of its characters . grady has spent the past half-decade evading decisions 
 and a funny one at that . the father of sally's unborn child also happened to be a married man 
 and a good time . okay . here's the story . this guy 
 and a grand use of natural sounds in place of music . he uses background music only twice in the film 
 and a great deal of dialogue . embracing a near real-time approach 
 and a great deal of genuinely funny material 
 and a great script . since the two aforementioned films came out before the prime target viewers of gladiator ( teenagers to thirty-year-old males ) were around 
 and a great supporting cast 
 and a homophobe . however 
 and a homosexual inmate who is granted a pardon but decides to commit suicide instead of letting his parents see what's happened to him while in jail . as ray and claude get older 
 and a host of others 
 and a jackson/robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson/travolta material from pulp fiction 
 and a jew-and-everybody-else equal opportunity hater . this includes animals . the action begins with mel ( who probably hates his parents for his name ) throwing his neighbor's beloved pooch verdell down the laundry chute . the neighbor 
 and a last-minute replacement with a bad attitude ( william fichtner ) . the skipper's convinced he can change his bad luck streak in remote flemish cap 
 and a lawyer's moral dilemma as he takes a case he thinks he cannot win . jeremy irons is claus von bulow 
 and a little profanity . a definate winner 
 and a load of potential powerhouse dramatic moments get ignored . margit 
 and a love story transcending the atlantic ocean itself . that 
 and a madman with a nuke walking among them . mimi leder is a natural at creating suspense . she reminds me of wolfgang petersen in her ability to make the most routine action sequences exciting and breathtaking . nicole kidman is an intelligent female action hero . you're not gonna find her falling down so clooney can come back to save her . george clooney is a real movie star . many of you may have hated him as batman 
 and a matter of semantics . as alea repeatedely phrased it ( with varations ) 
 and a meandering plotline that barely keeps you awake . sure 
 and a mediator . we see an emotional boxing match inside carter's head . from this point in the hole to the end of the film 
 and a menage-a-trois 
 and a mighty good one at that . plot : boy ( wahlberg ) meets girl ( witherspoon ) . boy likes girl . girl likes boy . boy and girl begin dating . parents of girl aren't crazy about the boy . girl steps to boy's defense . family problems occur . girl learns more about the boy . boy goes nuts . fun ensues . critique : ever wonder what would happen if your better half turned out to be someone other than the person that you had come to cherish and love ? well 
 and a mix of love 
 and a modern style expert known as the fad king ( leary ) . the initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv 
 and a more predatory attitude . unfortunately 
 and a motorcylce chase ( on a bmw cycle 
 and a mouth which is quick to smile . at the first meeting 
 and a much better one if you ask me ) . he is this movie and i was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through . he came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic 
 and a murder investigation is underway in charlotte 
 and a new breed that is introduced is no less so . the violence is appropriately grisly and extreme 
 and a new story begins . the press descends on sidney and her college to get the scoop on this sequel killer . they want to know all about the links between stab 
 and a pair of garden shears are stabbed in the neck of a bleeding portrait . he writes of his experiences and the town declares him a hero . finding it unsuitable against the family name 
 and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultra-cool morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) . morpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo ( keanu reeves ) 
 and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation . this effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr . tarantino as simply a helmer of slick 
 and a penchant for ass kicking . d's latest job involves a simple rescue operation to reclaim an affluent family's lovely daughter charlotte from the clutches of meier link 
 and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others 
" and a pint-sized "" guardian "" dragon called mushu ( eddie murphy ) . much like the gargoyles in the hunchback of notre dame "
 and a pleasant surprise when that finally lands a decent role in a funny film . nothing has been expected of rob schneider since his departure from the hellhole of mind-numbing roles like the copy guy richmeister and the weed guy on saturday night live 
 and a plot that won't ever put you to sleep . having said that 
 and a pocket knife from bob . as action films go 
 and a portion of them are fascinating and surprisingly multi- dimensional . glenn close turns in an insubstantial ( in terms of her career ) but magnificent performance as the conniving camille and is also the source of a good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy in this movie 
 and a pretty poor action hero . but 
 and a prospected life span of around 30 years . as a child 
 and a quasi-intellectual 
 and a remake of the 50s classic the thing . carpenter 
 and a short but dazzling performance by an actress who portrayed gar ming's girlfriend from vancouver ) . floating life is ultimately about the ties that bond a family together 
 and a silly romance ( wood declares her love for dean after talking to him for a couple hours ) it still is a fabulous film . the acting is so believable that it is no wonder that dean was considered the epitome of cool . now 
 and a simple plot by which to tie them all together . this one also includes plenty of toilet humour 
 and a slew of truly hateful characters that all get what they deserve by the end . the screenplay 
 and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes . williams is the only actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling . i have compared will to a foster child and that's not entirely fair . emotionally 
 and a snob in every sense of the word . on board 
 and a stick ( david hyde-pierce 
 and a strange encounter with playboy bunnies . willard' s four person crew finally make it to kurtz' compound 
 and a strong supporting cast of relative newcomers led by danny nussbaum as tim . meadows substitutes passion and energy for his lack of experience in making this film . in the end 
 and a stuart little read-along story ( which you can read yourself or have stuart read for you ) . there are also three music videos 
 and a sure-handed director 
 and a sweet side . kenny 
 and a tale of death and tragedy . . . this movie is about a tragic event that took place a great many years ago 
 and a terrible winter storm that leads to the eventual cannibalism . parker obviously knows his musicals very well 
 and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time . she knows how her society works 
 and a variety of relationships  male and female ; young 
 and a very compelling protagonist for the film . courtney love plays althea leasure in a startling turn 
 and a weird kind of love under the surface . as stan 
 and a whole lot of gore . this is brainless heaven . just remember not to think . 
 and a whole lot of shouting 
 and a witness to the pearl harbor bombings 
" and a woman he can't stop thinking about . he charges $10 but he is willing to negotiate . from now on he is considered deuce bigalow : male gigolo . with non-stop laughs an a abundence of crude humor "" deuce bigalow : male gigolo "" is sometimes like last years hit "" there's something about mary "" that is offensive but very funny . the screenplay by harris goldberg and rob schneider himself is a smart "
 and a wonderfully exciting action piece at the end 
 and aaliyah is obviously the female lead . with these two being cast in significant roles 
 and above all is a fine thematic picture . 
 and abrupt editing in an apparent attempt to keep any audience so confused trying to figure out what he is doing that they cannot become emotionally involved in his films . he got game 
 and accidentally detonating a massive set . many of the hollywood producers and big names want hrundi out of the business forever . and when the director makes a personal phone call to mr . clutterbuck ( j . edward mckinley ) pleading for hrundi's ejection from hollywood 
 and accidentally send the ship to a different galaxy through some space-gate or whatnot . lost in space suffers from the usual hollywood cliches and over the top action scenes that completely destroyed films like armageddon and con air . but 
 and action 
 and action . the fact that the film runs longer than most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewer's attention is held alternately by those three main elements 
 and actress terry moore 
 and acts like a three year old inside a 20-year old's body ? hell 
" and actually is able to maintain interest during the now required "" 40 minutes of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence "" style of moviemaking . the only downfall of the opening sequence is the editing style used . . . it's choppy slow-motion which is unsettling and distracting . it's similar to the opening sequence in saving private ryan "
 and adam brooks ( based on the novel by toni morrison ) starring : oprah winfrey 
 and adams remains a joy to watch . look for steve buscemi as well as a homeless bum . he's a hoot . directed by dennis dugan ( director of happy gilmore ) 
 and affectations of the 1980s . the soundtrack--an ever-present force in the film--is packed with wall-to-wall hits of the period 
 and after a few things go wrong 
 and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito 
 and after one of the local law enforcement officers witnesses this bizarre occurrence 
 and after the civil war . this plays a major factor in the film's success . to use such a historic setting presents many possibilities and problems since no one was alive at the time to verify its accuracy . it might also seem cliche 
 and after the movie's genuine dramatic setup 
 and after valjean breaks his parole 
 and again 
 and again this week 
" and agent kay notes the reason why he feels edwards should be the man to join the mib : he chased down the "" criminal "" on foot "
 and alan alda as the nationally famed reporter kevin hollander 
 and alexander baluyev ) aboard the comet-bombing spacecraft messiah 
" and all are "" lost in space "" . "" how do get back to earth ? "" is the question that infests the rest of this sci-fi epic . critique : this film reminded me a lot of the fifth element ( 6 . 5/10 ) from the summer of 1997 . it's a film with a lot of flash "
 and all in a crafty and accomplished manner . anyone who knows of 
 and all of the other things that occur in most of these films ? where else would pure escapism 
" and all that money ? well . "" titanic "" is big "
 and all that stuff . it's incidental 
 and all the characters are fully realized . the cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro ( who has worked with tarantino on previous films ) and the editing is very good . and as with pulp fiction 
 and all the effects were effective 
 and all the spaces in-between are controlled by thieves 
 and all without sounding remotely trite . immediately we get the sense that poker isn't for gamblers 
 and allegra is forced to flee with her bodyguard ( jude law ) . the game of existenz is not the normal virtual reality game that you would find in stores today . in existenz 
 and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction

 and ally sheedy as her lonely sister . walsh's clan 
 and almost seems to marry to get back at jackie for her success . when jackie lands on top and sees her sister marry a wonderful man 
 and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air . however 
 and along the way 
" and along the way they strike a pose and their slumber party pajamas are magically transformed into middle class streetwalker outfits . then they head to a party and dance suggestively with the guys while singing lyrics like "" i'll be your pleasure all the time . . . just say the words that you'll be mine "" . um . . . what the hell ? what does this have to do with stuart little ? how is this in any way a song suitable for a kids movie "
 and also adds some touches of droll humour . lyne uses some neat cinematic tricks to illustrate humbert's disquieting inner nightmares as he begins to lose control of the relationship . irons gives a confident and convincing performance in this tricky role 
 and also does the action scenes all right aswell . sutherland appears to be having fun as the doctor 
 and also extremely clever . the film even takes some jabs at america's nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war 
 and also somewhat true . it's great that beatty isn't afraid to let loose on a subject . talking of beatty 
 and also the most naive . fuentes is a true liberal 
 and also written by beatty 
 and although he wants to rekindle their relationship 
 and although her symbolism is obvious 
 and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying . the visual effects are astounding ( although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them ) and the movie is a thrilling triumph . if it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement . the climactic lightsaber battle ( oh 
 and although she provides little more than the usual female lead 
 and although the bond isn't immediate 
 and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists 
 and although the two more likely represent gen-x moronism and party-girl ditzism ( respectively ) 
 and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting 
 and although you really never fully root for either side 
 and alvin is too proud to ask anyone else for help . so alvin decides to hitch a trailer up to his battered old riding lawnmower and set out for wisconsin 
 and always chews the scenery . and speaking of the scenery 
 and always insightful human drama . the winter guest isn't about resolving plot threads and advancing a story line ; it's about exploring relationships and examining life in all of its stages . the winter guest does not tell a traditional tale 
 and always kept me wanting to see more and more of him ( his performance scored him a solid nomination from his core target audience 
 and always talking like he's out of breath )

 and an affair of love is one of them . as if to add insult to injury 
 and an edgy 
 and an excellent cast 
 and an incredible eight minute storyboard sequence detailing the original concept for the boat race scene ( with commentary from the director ) . the first commentary track features director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson . they give insightful and detailed thoughts about the film's production . minkoff likes to point out scenes where other screenwriters came in and polished up the script 
 and an ingratiating personality . he'll be around for a while . dreamworks is off to a satisfying start with peacemaker . 
 and an innocent bystander gets shot as well -- and now takeda is after * them * . and they run 
 and an offer by her to spend the night with him is very tempting . hearing charlie sheen deliver the line 
 and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack 
 and an oscar nomination  all for his sophomore outing 
 and an uncle . the knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin . nobody came to his rescue when he was being teased 
 and andrew stanton ( story by john lasseter 
 and andrew stanton ) starring : dave foley 
 and andy kemler getting drunker and drunker as the track continues and you still haven't scratched the surface of the extras . there's also behind the scenes footage of the shooting of the film 
 and angela douglas is very effective in her role as the revengeful daughter . other regulars that appear in this movie include charles hawtrey and bernard bresslaw ( in his debut ) as big heap and little heap respectively . big heap is the local indian leader and the crazy casting of hawtrey for this part is very amusing 
 and annie finds herself falling in love with all things montana 
" and annie rejects the advice of her vet ( cherry jones ) to "" put him down "" seeking out a horse whisperer to restore his sanity . "" the horse whisperer "" encompasses two epic stories during its ample "
 and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale

 and answering what may be his true calling 
 and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting 
 and any intelligent watching of the film should make that obvious . does the lead character 
 and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem . satire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain people's minds

 and he is extremely hesitant to take the case . nevertheless 
 and he is given ample oppurtunity to display this talent throughout the film . i believe that matthew perry's primary talent is his wide range of facial expressions 
 and he is put into the shoes of a drug dealer who has some wild adventures with some wild friends . through these multiple stories

 and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent ; he's the real deal . this new aspect of mr . tarantino's storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character -- that of the world-weary 
 and here 
 and here he manages to accentuate the strengths of nearly all the actors . the only character who weakens the payoff is crystal's bride-to-be ( lisa kudrow ) . playing the same dumbed-down role as she does in friends 
 and here he succeeds at both in a way . you can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end 
 and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah . though his hairstyle is absurd 
 and high contrast black-and-white cinematography combined with constant usage of extreme close-ups lend a heightened sense of paranoia to the proceedings . ( in some scenes

 and his adaptation of vladimir nabokov's controversial 1958 novel lolita further explores these themes . however 
 and his addiction to drugs ( amphetamines 
 and his american debut goes the distance to prove that he is here to stay . the story is particularly simple : a vietnam vet is murdered by a group of trigger-happy hunters--partial to that race of human beings--and the man's daughter goes looking for him . it seems he was homeless

 and his best directing effort 
 and his best friend pelayo ( fele martinez ) brings with him sofia ( penelope cruz ) 
 and his brother's former lover 
 and his central argument -- that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men 
 and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film . for instance 
 and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films . gibson again teams up with richard donner 
 and his continued escapades with ryder 
 and his crisp and stylish direction is the perfect cinematic equivalent of stark's terse prose . gibson was apparently unhappy with the tyro director's finished film 
" and his current comedy in the works -- "" romeo and ethel "
 and his discomfort is obvious . but there is only one scene where he does so 
 and his discoveries soon lead him to an ominous-looking plant in mexico . there he meets an environmentalist whose work is increasingly troubling in its extraordinary reports on the earth's atmostphere . the story probably sounds a little cliched 
 and his entrace into the temple . his rise out of the water 
 and his eye's begin to pop . . . . . then doug quaid 
 and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in the truman show . mark steven johnson's sense of drama and writing is fantastic . the script is loosely based on john irving's novel 
 and his final conversion to the side of good 
 and his final scene is a very touching and heartwrenching one . loren dean gives a nice performance in his well-developed character . dean is also responsible for some of the most suspenseful scenes in the movie . alan arkin portrays one of the detectives with a little less more excitement than with his psychiatrist in grosse pointe blank . still 
 and his finn is quite a likeable guy . paltrow's estella 
 and his friend roper wants to make money in order to pay gambling debts . the plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced by james bond ( the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later ) . the main hero was faced against a power-hungry megalomaniac on a remote island 
 and his ghost runs into the movie . while it appears to be a random killing at first 
 and his glorious triumph in philadelphia

 and his mom is in constant self-denial and solves all perceived problems by baking . then 
 and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable . the script is generally cheerful 
 and his more mature buddy ramon 
 and his nice guy personality wins us over easily . in fact 
 and his old-school patience for things to get better is not shared by today's press 
 and his oldest daughter allison ( marcia gay harden 
 and his other son 
 and his overbearing wife certainly isn't any help . jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners 
 and his pal plato ( sal mineo ) pretend they are adults . they use upper class british accents and in their conversations they make it out to appear that kids are no good and should be ignored . this scene shows that what was once cool in a past generation is the complete opposite in another . speaking on behalf of my generation 
 and his performance here is again impressive . joan cusack 
 and his photography of denise richards' climbing out of the pool is a highlight . the cinematography is gorgeous in its details . its not often that you see a film like this 
 and his rather faceless crew ( ron eldard 
 and his right-hand man 
 and his scenes are nice and underplayed . he is eliminated early 
 and his secretary ( mary kay place ) is a paranoid deaf flirt . even more odd is a hole in the wall of craig's office 
 and his sincerity makes the apt pupil's blackening-heart even more apparent . but one of the film's ultimate questions 
 and his solutions are very concrete . it is nearly impossible to fathom the nature of harry's obsession with michel's early poem 
 and his son would become king louis xvi . such is the setting for beaumarchais : the scoundrel about the controversial playwright 
 and his squad of merciless soldiers are replaced by genetically engineered warriors . believed dead

 and his wife are picture perfect . his idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky . the radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart . . . but then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light ? the next day during the drive to work 
 and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year . he plays a young man named derek vinyard 
 and his younger brother danny ( edward furlong ) years later when derek is let out of prison he comes to see a shaved head nazi danny . derek has been reformed the hardness of prison and he is shocked at how evil danny has become . he tries desparately to change his younger brother . he shocks his former friends with his reformed self and this sets off a night long adventure of running and trying to set things right . edward norton gives the performance of his career as derek . flashback scenes show him musclebound 
 and ho-hum flicks like the hudsucker proxy and raising arizona were more the norm for the coen brothers . they undoubtedly are . in the big lebowski 
" and holds its own against the movie's more flashy physical shtick . vicki lewis ( beth from "" newsradio "" ) is solid in a supporting role as lars' money-grubbing wife . and in a nifty bit of novelty casting "

 and hopeful 
 and hopefully her appeal will cross over to america . open your eyes is an incredible movie 
 and hopes that his charisma can make up for his character not being well developed enough to really be a person . i hate to do this 
 and hot shots to name a few . but although the zucker/abrahams/zucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in 1977 
 and how each of them deals with their last night of life . the film contains no science fiction elements 
 and how it should be rewarded . however 
 and how it was conceived and produced 
 and how profoundly the absence of the former can affect the latter . and of course it deals with the familiar science-fiction notion of how changing one seemingly innocuous event can have major ramifications on things long after . but 
 and how the power 
 and how they equate celebrity-hood with happiness . we never get close enough to the actual celebrities to see if they're really happy ( they may appear to be on the surface . . . ) 
 and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different . perhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action -- catching the 10 am train 
 and how to keep them from affecting him . shrink after shrink refuses to return after will's mockery . lambeau's last hope is his old college roommate 
 and hugo weaving are all effectual . one of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last year's science fiction masterpiece dark city

" and hurting them until their death . the ending of "" jude "" is bleak because it has to be ( although i hear the ending of the novel is even worse - guess i'll have to read it now ) . "" jude "" offers a satirical view on society's cruelties "
 and i also find it very hard to believe that those who do watch would be let down by this . if there's a flaw to this 
 and i anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination . everyone has been raving about thandie newton's performance 
" and i can stand almost anything ( i recently viewed the 2 1/2 hour long epic "" caligula "
 and i can't imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors * really * included karate-chopping blocks of stone in two -- it's rather remarkable that a movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory . the film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset ; although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately 
 and i could always use a free movie 
 and i couldn't quite work out who the voice was . ( but e-mail if you do . ) the songs are good 
 and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nice-looking that it actually qualifies as art . of course 
" and i don't have the evidence . i know what happened but you shouldn't take my word alone . "" that is the voice of science speaking . the character of david drumlin is another problem with this film . his attitudes toward pure research project seem out of place for a person in his position . also "
 and i don't just mean in terms of subject matter ! -- reproduces very poorly . also 
 and i don't mind too much . but the film doesn't insult my intelligence -- it's pitched perfectly to entertain 
 and i don't think anybody will find a good excuse . and when the film nears an end 
 and i don't want to give too much away 
 and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably . it is a sad testament when a person's true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them 
 and i enjoyed it a lot . 
 and i for one 
 and i found myself looking for matt damon's reactions instead . a good thing about rounders is that it doesn't get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can't find time for humor . the film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going 
 and i found that i didn't really care about them or their fate . nick nolte is dynamic as the obsessed and driven colonel who relishes his first opportunity to fight a war after fifteen years in the army 
 and i give it * * * stars . 
 and i had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on which the movie was based . my real concern 
 and i have more respect for the picture than to believe that . in the end 
 and i hope he alternates between directing and acting . my only quibble with the film is that we never find out why the world is ending . i really wanted to know 
" and i hope he can keep it up . now everyone can argue logic this and logic that all you want with the sci-fi elements of frequency . but the fact of the matter is that time travel has never been achieved . who's to say how something works and how it doesn't when it's never happened ? is it because we've become accustomed to time travel "" laws "" from other places like "" star trek "" and the back to the future trilogy and "" quantum leap "" ? yes "
 and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema that's out there . all in all 
 and i love it for it 
 and i must say that his look was deliciously reprehensible . plenty of cameos also pepper this kaleidoscopic moving picture in the form of ellen barkin 
" and i never have thought much of "" greased lightening "
" and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tv's "" frasier "" ) as an army general called in by agent mansley . unlike several cartoon features "
 and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks . lost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies . his humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today 
 and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable . the edge is rated r for graphic violence 
 and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen . . . in a movie theater in seattle 
 and i say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some guy in bandages 
 and i suspect she brought that knowledge of already being in lucy's footsteps to her role . also very good is radha mitchell as syd 
 and i think it would have made him generally better-rounded . none of the other actors have substantial screen time 
 and i thought it was worth every penny . the characterizations are mostly flat 
 and i thought that was kind of a neat connection . sorry about the segue 
 and i want to see more of them . 
 and i was dismayed to see eponine 
 and i was especially surprised at the solid performance by tv friend's matt leblanc who shows us all that he's definitely more than just a pretty face . on the down side 
 and i was half-expecting some sort of stupid kiddie song that would be entirely unrelated to the spirit of the original . but as soon as the theme began 
 and i was particularly impressed by how so many of the claymation puppets were given distinct mannerisms 
 and i wish i had skipped home alone 2 
 and i wish there had been another scene where they confronted each other . this is a very minor fault 
 and i won't say that here . however 
 and i would be able to sit and watch it . now i've seen it twice -- once last november 
 and i would definately recommend the dvd of 'the matrix . reviewed by brandon herring september 28 
 and i would have settled with a more implausible beginning that would have moved the story along better . once george clooney and nicole kidman enter the picture 
" and i'd imagine the filmmakers probably meant "" southern france . "" why mention this ? because i wanted to point out that one can't apply logic to maximum risk and expect it to work . in fact "
" and i'll be hoping that the mouse from "" mouse hunt "" knocks some sense back into mickey . nathan lane ( robin williams' significant other from "" the birdcage "" ) and lee evans ( last seen as a nervous bellhop in "" the fifth element "" ) play ernie and lars smuntz "
 and i'm agreeing that it deserves the mantle . not many horror/suspense do 
 and i'm glad i did . though by far not an original movie 
 and i'm glad i'm able to share this review with you . a man is on a train with francois pignon ( villeret ) when he begins to pull out pictures of different things he has built out of matches . guess how many matches it took ? he asks 
 and i'm glad to see him bigger than life again ( recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing ) . tyler and affleck are great together 
 and i'm happy to report that the fight sequences are indeed something to behold . the problem is 
" and i'm just glad that such moments don't dominate the film . "" erin brockovich "" is not necessarily better than the films i previously mentioned "
 and i'm not going to even try . they're just really 
 and i'm not saying i didn't like it . what i'm saying is the first half was extremely slow . now seeing the trailer it makes you think the whole entire movie is one big special effects show . don't be fooled 
 and i'm the first to admit that . maybe it's that it never totally lets go and takes off into real innocent fun - it's too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging 
 and i'm thrilled that paramount agrees with me that clue is a film worthy of being preserved on this great digital format . [pg] reviewed by chuck dowling - chuckd21@fdn . com aol instant messenger : filmjax the jacksonville film journal - http : //www . jaxfilmjournal . com/

 and indeed the film on the whole is very good . it is a stunningly flawed expression of film 
 and inevitably leads to the point where one of the brothers' wives or girlfriends does something independently impetuous 
 and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants . it takes a pretty smart person to do that . but what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ? what if he's also able to think on his feet ? in fact 
 and initial reports said the film was unwatchable . thankfully 
 and innovative music . it gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes a warm look at the dalai lama as a person . on top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese 
 and insecure 
 and instead of a straight-forward 
 and instead of action puts emphasis on characters and prosaic details of their work . the movie doesn't try to romanticise the mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes ; they are simply shown as deadly yet expendable tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda . christopher walken played in many movies 
 and instead of just flushing him 
 and instead were part of an experiment in a giant space terrarium manipulated by intergalactic alien zookeepers ? in dark city john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) has this problem . dark city starts out like a 1940s noir amnesia detective mystery . poor john wakes up with amnesia in a hotel room with a dead dame in one corner . a mysterious phone call tells him to get the heck out of there 
 and intellectually stimulating

 and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie . woody faces difficult choices 
 and is about his inability to find meaning in anything . that's not as bleak as it sounds 
 and is actually integral to the plot 
 and is all the better for it -- even if he's in a paper-thin story . the plot ( what a word ! ) : jackie is a tv chef living in australia who specializes in on-screen acrobatics with his food . one day he collides with a journalist who's just filmed a drug deal that ended in violence 
 and is all the better for it . and be warned : as a result

 and is there for the sole purpose of supplying comic relief . yes 
 and is therefore boring . . . except that he is played by will smith

 and it almost destroys annie . she tries to commit suicide 
" and it also has disney to insure that it's g-rated and not totally over kids' heads like "" antz "" was ( not a bad thing "
 and it also keeps the tear-jerking scenes from seeming obligatory . in my review of antz 
 and it basically does not stop . that is 
 and it bugged me immensely . there is no special effects work 
 and it carries this one . 
 and it ceases poking fun and starts asking questions -- questions which 
 and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects . the interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail 
 and it could happen to you - what a combo ! ) who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once . it's nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire . the two aren't very comparable to each other 
 and it could have been trimmed . it manages to hold the attention 
 and it could have used a better ending . the film progressed wonderfully before ending suddenly 
 and it deserves to be 
 and it does have the one thing that no other film has but allen's : that great woody allen feel . it may be not exactly fresh and lively or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject 
 and it does not disappoint . brooks plays john henderson 
 and it doesn't feature a great showdown in a courtroom . instead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession 
 and it doesn't make sense . 1 : 41 - pg-13 for violence and thematic elements 
 and it doesn't overwhelm the rest of the movie . on the whole 
 and it doesn't take long for them to come to the realisation that they're being two-timed by the same guy . more indignant with him than catty with each other 
 and it even includes a scene not in the film itself ( a scene that should have been in the film 
 and it features some of the best emoting either actor has ever done . ) notting hill is nonetheless enjoyable ; on the visual side of things 
 and it feels like it ; the material is just stretched too thin in order to fulfill a feature length running time 
 and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship . just prior to heading back to earth 
 and it has a truly explosive impact to it ( especially in the climax 
 and it has a use beyond the obvious

" and it is also one of the better performances he has given . giovanni ribisi ( 2000's "" the boiler room "" ) is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend "
 and it is as meticulously crafted and evocative as his previous work . he gives this war film an almost elegiac quality and a rare humanity . his sweeping vision is complemented by the spectacularly gorgeous cinematography of dual oscar winner john toll and the haunting score from hans zimmer . 
 and it is as though he is regurgitating words heard or read elsewhere ; his favorite subject is popular music 
 and it is fantastic entertainment . despite excellent direction from tarantino 
 and it is impeccable . michel and claire never get hysterical or grotesquely quarrelsome during their daily rituals . the core of their disorganized and turbulent family unit is established early in the film 
 and it is no wonder that even his children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during christmas 
 and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in a hollywood movie . gods and monsters has no interest in being a biopic of whale's life because it tracks only the final few days of his life 
 and it is offensive . luckily 
 and it is one hell of a movie . the scenes are bold 
 and it is shockingly moving . . . expressing a seriousness that heretofore was unassociated with the character 
 and it is unclear if he will ever actually find himself in combat . when he sets out on a documenting mission 
" and it is with "" at first sight "" that she finally has another juicy role to play . in a truthful climactic scene set in amy's apartment between she and virgil "
 and it lives up to the hints given in previews . the only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect full-blown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness . ronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish 
 and it looked utterly disgusting . ) in the scenes where a bus's sign changes to indicate its destination 
 and it looks great . the movie's soundtrack is also used to convey the dark tone of the film . ( skip to the next paragraph if you have yet to see the movie - there is a spoiler in the following sentences . ) during the opening prehistoric sequence 
 and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow 
 and it looks quite cool ) . keaton is still the definitive batman 
 and it looks that 
 and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce . as it is 
 and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory 
 and it may have sappy music 
 and it needs to get back with reality . and for the most part 
 and it pays off . the film isn't only around to deliver heavy-handed messages 
 and it proves that life 
 and it proves to be one of the most entertaining movies of the year so far . john sullivan ( james caviezel ) is a cop in 1999 new york . he has just broken up with his girlfriend 
" and it reduces "" enemy of the state "" to a mechanical mishmash of flashy images that never expand the mind at any great depths "
 and it seems to be tearing her apart 
 and it serves as the best introduction to the mammary-mad director . i wasn't too sure what to think when john waters raved in his memoirs that faster 
 and it shows . in his fights 
 and it shows why he earned the reputation of capable 
 and it snaps ; but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther . in simon birch 
 and it takes quite a while to get going 
 and it thankfully avoids any sappy finale . it may not enter the pantheon of holiday classics 
 and it thrived on being the central juncture of east-west commerce . the film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice 
 and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting . billy zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal 
 and it was nothing more than that . that is until about half-way through the movie . suddenly 
 and it was playing in a theater 
 and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot . even when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere ( laura duke condominas ) 
 and it was the first picture he helmed . while the milagro beanfield war was only occasionally successful at combining magic-realism with . . . um 
 and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a great person . through the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone 
 and it wasn't meant to be a joke . however 
 and it would be criminal to give away the film's secrets . suffice to say that 
 and it wraps too abruptly . but disney's first effort ( he is credited 
 and it's a damn good ride that could hold its own in any summer . . . or any season of any year 
 and it's a huge loss to the acting world . i've always been fascinated with reed . . . he's one of those very talented performers who once had a fine career but ended up in direct to video junk during his twilight years . it's ironic that this film probably would have gotten him back into real movies again 
 and it's a little cramped in there 
 and it's a shame his material wasn't more consistent . his interaction with the boys 
 and it's about time that mainstream america found out . the ever-charismatic chow will certainly have no trouble winning new fans with his english language debut 
 and it's all rather lovely to look at . and then we cut to a film crew 
 and it's all stuff we've seen before . however 
 and it's always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it . the screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems head-on in realistic manners . however 
 and it's an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy . but even though the two leads do an impressive job 
 and it's another good bet this month . since quality is usually sparse during the early fall months 
 and it's as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel . the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever 
 and it's clear that no matter what sacrifices michel has had to make for his girls 
 and it's damaging him . he gets through the long days and nights on a diet of whisky 
 and it's damn good . adapted from a best-selling john berendt novel based on true events 
" and it's definitely fit for the "" alien "" series . "
 and it's director brett rainer . rush hour features jackie chan in his first u . s . action movie 
 and it's even harder to beleive that their breakup wouldve been amicable enough for her to still want to work for him . but conflict is necessary says these screenwriting books 
 and it's hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character -- in a monologue to his mirrored reflection 
 and it's hard to suppress a cheer when frank survives the fire 
 and it's just about time . for over twenty-five years 
 and it's just likable . most importantly 
 and it's kind of fun watching the genre played out intelligently for once . i liked someof the physical acting between paltrow and mortensen 
 and it's nice to see . it gives you 
" and it's no wonder that he is one of the largest film stars in china . i do hope that his next film contains a few more fights and a lot less melodrama . one last thing i must note ; several fights in "" romeo must die "" are blatantly enhanced by cgi . this was completely uncalled for "
 and it's not because she's attractive 
 and it's not long before he's running from reynolds' cronies . it's only with the help of an ex-spook named brill ( gene hackman ) that dean is able to get to the bottom of things . the acting is top notch 
 and it's occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element . one member of the supporting cast deserves special notice . douglas mcferran 
 and it's only poor judgment that allows the most-eagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults . one aspect that will appeal broadly 
 and it's possible she's joining merely to follow rico 
 and it's probably a better movie for it . it's focus is on whale's ( ian mckellen ) untraditional and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) . it begins with whale ( a fairly talented artist 
 and it's scary the way that it shows a man's decent into kafkaism 
" and it's take on the evolution of bugs is a lot better than the one in "" antz . "" it's also light and clever . the visuals are "
 and it's touching . it's got that great cheezy humor

 and its much better than any of those . sam raimi took a departure from his normal freak-show horror-monkey films and made this stylish and intriguing picture . he really lets the audience sit back and watch the events unfold rather than force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do . i think raimi knew he had a winner on his hands and decided to direct the picture on a natural flowing course . one of the film's components can be linked to a recurring theme in terrence malick's the thin red line . in malick's three hour bore-a-thon

 and just a bit predictable . but the film embraces it's spirit making this light-hearted romantic comedy a sure one to go see .

 and makes humbert something of a sympathetic figure . he convincingly conveys humbert's ever increasing sense of guilt and remorse . his voice over narration provides insight into his obsession 
 and makes it a fun little romp as a result . the one drawback of curdled is that it was based on a short film 
 and makes money by doing what he does best : having sex . one day

 and makes the plot's unfolding highly predictable . finally 
 and makes the story of a world-reknowned cellist who contracts ms and dies prematurely into the story of two sisters 
 and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family . sethe is proud 
 and makes you leave the theater unable to realize what point the film was trying to make . maybe part of the problem was the fact that true crime used three screenwriters to adapt andrew klavan's novel 
 and makes you think that maybe this isn't the leisurely paced drama you were watching for the past two hours . the film's ending happens to quickly to digest 
 and makeup 
 and making him kind of child-like at other times . kate winslet

 and malkovich's discovery of what's going on . i don't want to reveal too much ; this is just the set-up 
 and managed to raise a family at the same time . this is one of roberts's most impressive performances 
 and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful it's fascinating . two other characters act as catalysts 
 and many of the characters just generally aren't as weird or unique . instead of depicting a city populated by mostly normal people and then showing us the strangeness that we might not have noticed at first 
 and many others .  those men were talented artists 
 and many public marches for his freedom 
 and marital discontent . i might have forgotten about the release of abba's third album in there 
 and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill the gloom of schrader's screenplay into the silver screen . new york city in the night is portrayed as a hell on earth 
 and marvin's newfound animal instincts naturally kick into full effect when he's released back into the general population . stupid ? yes . i just never would have thought a cross-dressing monkey doing the moonwalk would be so damn funny . marvin meets and falls in love with the chick from the first season of survivor ( colleen haskell ) 
 and max's effective isolationism is emphasized by shots from the so-called snorri cam 
 and maximus ( as well as his family ) is sentenced to be executed . maximus is able to escape his executioners

 and more rude and bitter ) 
 and more than a few balls are dropped in the resulting juggling act . alleged last-minute edits and reshoots are more than likely to blame for the occasionally rushed development and ambiguous interaction 
 and more than a few teen movies are using the bard as inspiration . we knew it wouldn't be long before we had another period piece shakespeare adaptation . the film is michael hoffman's rich

 and mortal kombat 
 and most blatantly of all : canada ! parker and stone have cross-referenced all the inventive ways to make fun of we canadians 
 and most importantly 
 and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex 
 and most likable characters one will ever see . she and scarlett become very dear friends 
 and most obviously 
 and most of all 
 and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston . johnston -- whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well-known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars -- certainly knows what he's doing here . he molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust . he does not push any barriers 
 and most of the characters have southern texan accents . drew barrymore's accent tends to come and go ( luke wilson doesn't seem to have this problem ) . as well 
 and most of the genuine laughs . and two 
 and most of the reason they work is style . sukeban deka has its over-the-top-ness right about 80% of the time . one of the evil girls in the story wears cammo fatigues underneath her negligee ; another dresses like a walking bondage outfitter's ad and hides snakes in her cleavage . ( the fetish for snakes bleeds over into the intercollary images that flash up between scenes : when someone gets double-crossed 
 and most of them occur when jesus is attempting to preach . = there are moments of brief awe and power 
 and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere . but 
 and most people could care less . but she soon forms a bond with bobby delaughter ( baldwin ) a lawyer who pursues the case for over five years . his job is to track down witnesses ( most of them dead ) and keep the case going even if no real evidence is found . when he first views the case as 
 and most recently 
 and mostly no gory close-ups ( save for a set of teeth ) 
 and motions for her to come join them . instantly 
 and motivations . even the heavy 
 and move to a lovely country house 
 and moving . a character actor who played one of the patients in cuckoo's nest and one of salieri's servants in amadeus gives a great performance of a ghost trapped in the new york subway . the biggest flaw in this movie is the editing . many scenes run on too long . the director and film editor should have shaven about 10-20 minutes from the movie 
 and moving performance as a man who before building the baseball field had done nothing crazy or spontaneous in his entire life . costner gives ray just the right mix of enthusiasm and idealism to make us believe in his mystic visions and swallow this wondrous fairy tale . amy madigan gives a fine supporting performance as ray's feisty and loving wife 
 and mr . toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner . two girls and a guy falls short of its potential 
 and mr . tuttle ( eric sykes ) 
 and much younger man 
 and mulan's later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy 
 and murderers . the opening and closing shots are a wonderful contrast to the rest of the gloomy 
 and muriel's wedding unfolds from there . toni collette plays muriel in a winning performance 
 and must be commended for juggling a number of people and subplots one would expect to find in a robert altman flick . whether we're watching bridges fend off a marmet in his bathtub or moore don viking duds and dance in a busby berkeley-esque dream sequence 
 and must display this well to make her character believable and she does just that . her lack of chemistry with macy 
 and my cousin vinny 
 and my feeling was that this could never be a great man 
 and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again 
 and my need to know was hanging over the film at all times . i appreciate the fact that mckellar didn't want the material to rule the film 
 and my neighbor totoro 
 and nails every one of them : it's a film that both loves shakespeare and makes fun of him 
 and narrow escapes 
 and near-deaths due to fires 
 and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether . i've heard about this kind of thing happening before 
 and needed to wrap up quickly . it's a shame 
 and needs some serious cash . craig becomes employed as a file clerk on floor seven-and-a-half of a new york city skyscraper . ( the ceilings are very low . ) the boss ( orson bean ) is a 105-year old pervert obsessed with carrot juice 
 and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end . to solve this case 
 and neither is gonzo . during the latter half of the film 
 and neither is snowbell the family cat ( voiced by nathan lane ) . george and stuart eventually bond while preparing for a remote control boat race 
 and neither is willing to admit that they need the other . much of their interaction is argumentative 
 and never gets too involved in what it is 
 and never got the recognition he would have liked 
 and never has a good word to say to anyone . so 
 and never holds up . there are some great shots 
 and never interferes with the drama . scenes do not follow typical hollywood constructions ; there isn't a little climax every five minutes 
 and never really challenges or surprises us . but it's intelligently written ( with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant ) 
 and never really inflicting harm or hurt on others . actor stephen fry is an uncanny match for wilde . he even looks like him

 and no matter how many special effects john woo brings into the mix 
 and no matter how noble the cause 
 and no one else can do it like them . unfortunately 
 and no sooner . there's also no point in the movie where the plot slows down . it's a quick 
 and no stupid sidekicks . instead this is a wonderful film with a good message 
 and nobody seems to remember what they did this morning ? and how come nobody seems to remember how to leave the city 
 and non-goateed 
 and none other than vincent's long lost brother 
 and norton does it all with ease . even when he's at his meanest 
" and not a sign that i need to take writing classes . and when you see "" being john malkovich "" "
 and not all for the good . somehow 
 and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action . much of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters' subplots . i won't suggest that these are complex characters 
 and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay 
 and not enough time letting us get to know the other characters . the plot is inconsequential . the power of the movie comes in how it paints for us a scene of a society and a people we have never met 
 and not even the comedy sidekick ( this time in the form of a taxi driver ) is annoying . one disappointing aspect 
 and not from some contrived 
 and not in the u . s . of a . woo's the killer had so much word of mouth in japan 
 and not just in catholics . yet for the most part 
 and not just to one man's character and determination 
 and not knowing what would ultimately happen to them at any given moment  whether she 
 and not much happens in the earlygoings . viewers may be growing restless for a while 
 and not on the disaster itself . the plot is anything but original and the dialogues sometimes resemble a television soap-opera . the director doesn't even try to overcome his empty script . because of its primitive and predictable plot 
 and not original 
 and not precisely ineffective -- reasonable amounts of humour are elicited 
 and not that of writer morrison or director demme 
 and not the least bit contrived . now teaming with co-director peter lord 
 and not worry about how it may or may not affect him 
 and nothing more 
 and nothing will change that . just as annie gets her life back in order 
" and novice movie-watchers may take this opportunity to see their first "" artsy "" film . life is beautiful is an artsy movie by convention but easily accessible to everyone "
 and now floodwaters are rising so high that buildings are being submerged and the nearby dam is about to break . enter a working class smart-alecky new armored car driver named tom ( christian slater ) . suddenly his security truck carrying over three million dollars gets stuck on the flooded street and is waylaid by armed looters . tom has no choice but to grab the bag full of money 
" and now in "" stuart little "" he brings the most out of snowball and makes him one of those characters we love to dislike . for the human actors geena davis who never gives a bad performance does not disappoint here as well . she fits nicely in her character and there is a good chemistry between her and hugh laurie who plays mr . little . both make us believe they are happily in love and married and jonathan lipnicki as their song is even more adorable than he was in 1996's "" jerry maguire "" . even though stuart little is completely cgi "

 and obnoxious at the same time . and i laughed at rob ( john cusack ) 
 and obnoxiously noisy at times . but it's fun to be obnoxious sometimes . the special effects in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame . deep impact 
 and obviously not cheaply done at all . they pack a ton of detail into the images 
 and occasionally cringe ; because of barking dogs 
 and occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation . the characters are well-developed 
 and occasionally there will be a shot that is indistinguishable from live action . this is a lush 
 and of a murdered wife and child whose deaths he must avenge . crowe brings an evenness to the role which makes maximus seem more real than similar characters in other movies . likewise 
 and of a small law firm versus the infinite funds of grace and beatrice . the latter's platoons of lawyers are headed by a powerhouse memorably --if a little too colorfully-- played by robert duvall 
 and of course 
 and of course .1
 and of course arnie tones it down with a one liner 
 and of course those cool gadgets and we get plenty of that here as bond goes out to investigate carver and finds himself in a jam or two along the way . the story works much like bond himself - always on the run and concentrates more on the individual conflicts than any general plot . somehow a chinese agent

 and offers his assistance 
 and offers up a fair share of chills 
 and often envied . at one point 
 and often unlikable . if there had been a few extra scenes with gallagher 
 and often wrong choices in their life . the casting of casablanca was right on target not just in a case of main leads . the supporting actors also did a marvellous job . sidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic - john huston's maltese falcon ; yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original characters . another shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid as the weakest part of love triangle ; character of victor laszlo has believable charisma and looks like a somebody who could inspire millions of people to rise against nazi tiranny . unfortunately 
 and on a superficial level some of their motivations 
 and on his release he seems doomed to a life of crime and squalor . however 
 and on the common folks that ran the day-to-day operations . the contrast is amazing 
 and on the field . then we realise 
 and on the older people's enhanced comprehension . it's a risky strategy which bespeaks more of mazursky as a nostalgic film-buff than as a calculating businessman . at 105 minutes 
 and on the surface

" and one -- "" i'll make a man out of you "" ( unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean fighting machines ) -- becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable . only "" reflections "" "
 and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author 
 and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing . some of the lines are also pretty bad - in one instance 
 and one day 
 and one day all his pent-up rage externalises itself . . . as a split personality 
 and one day at the local tavern the two share stories of the horrors of war . this is a beautifully acted sequence and again 
 and one expects floating life to depict the clash of cultures as the chans struggle to acclimatize themselves to the new ways of australian life as they integrate themselves into australian society ( a scene where the two teen sons meet up with a sunbathing neighbourhood girl is left dangling ) 
 and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was . and although it's true that several scenes are similar 
 and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic . with regard to the exteriors

 and one of gibson's nastier and more disposable efforts . 
 and one of his cronies 
 and one of the `hot' scenes involving supporting actress daisy ( heather graham ) removing her blouse . bowfinger takes it's sweet time getting started 
 and one of the details that elevates it beyond your normal noir-ish crime story . the leonard movies are more obsessed with dialogue than crime

 and playing his character was probably a little more tricky than it appears . it was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity 
 and plays it better than ever . he even looks better in the suit here ( incidentally 
 and plays out its elements well . the movie finds a tone and sticks with it 
 and plot twists are never really taken seriously . the ending

 and pulled off a neat trick : a war tale full of battles that takes place after a truce has been declared . if he set out to make something socially/culturally/politically/globally significant 
 and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful and outrageous . keaton's wardrobe is equally appropriate . batman's cape

 and quite clever . they're not cringe inducing

" and refuses the advances of our philandering hero . they make a great team . "" tomorrow never dies "" is a surprisingly entertaining and efficient film "
 and relatively shallow interpretation . the film takes place during the renaissance 
 and reliance on the lead performances is huge . the set-up has some obvious problems 
 and relishing in the cheeze some call film . . . have a blast ! ! two scenes to watch for are both within the first ten minutes of this gore-fest . the opening sequence is one of the most rockin' scenes to open any action movie 
 and remove the obligatory ( and somewhat unrealistic ) romance 
 and renderers may one day be regarded as the first and finest examples of a new kind of artist . one quickly gets the sense watching this movie that lasseter and his gang have never stopped playing with their toys . in their world

 and richard nixon 
 and rick's final words leave room for even more outrageous speculations . together with well-drawn characters and exciting story 
 and ricky jay starts looking for the exit to this mess of a film . a mamet production usually derives its success from a solid emotional attachment to its characters -- usually they've been wronged and are seeking justice or absolution . the nave scientist from the spanish prisoner or the curious psychologist from house of games were just decent people we recognize in our everyday lives . when those people get royally screwed over 
 and riding through space with these poor souls . unfortunately for this chosen family

" and robert altman decides that it is time to set the plot in motion . we see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture of her husband . she exclaims "" here i come ! "" and then puts a pillow to her face and shoots herself . soon after "
 and robert duvall spends most of his on-screen time just looking weird . it doesn't seem like he does much because he has very little spoken dialogue 
 and robert forster . more than likely 
 and robert redford's direction is especially superb . the performances turned in by john turturro 
 and rockhound ( steve buscemi ) . there's also an interesting triangle formed between a . j . 
 and rod steiger . directed by norman jewison written by armayan bernstein and dan gordon denzel washington is among the many actors this holiday season to give very impressive milestone performances . this perhaps may be washington's very best to date . he joins matt damon and jim carrey in having the talent 
 and ronin becomes a better movie because of it . robert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time . he takes command and offers much gravity as the ex-spy sam 
 and rugby . she studied ballet at the royal academy of dance in london 
 and ruins everything for the entire colony : the grasshopper's leader 
 and running into ( on more than one occasion ) a chinese secret agent like him : wai lin ( michelle yeoh

 and runs amok through the streets of la 
 and runs away to hilary's country home 
 and runs into a lady studying why the temperature of the earth has dangerously risen so suddenly . zane is having marital problems at the time 
 and runs into two more people that she knew in high school . she gets a job as a worker at a one hour photo store . she runs into even more people there as they come in and out of the store to get their pictures developed . she messes up a lot of pictures 
 and sam neill--better than i've seen him before--round out the respectable supporting cast . and the director's respect for horses is clearly in evidence . one word of warning

 and saving handcuffed heroes from drowning

 and scenes that'll make you laugh out loud . witness the episode in which our good-natured protagonists bind frank ( played by peter caffrey ) to a hotel bed 
 and scenes which are blatantly over-stylized . the tone of the book is a comical one 
 and schneider sells it for all he's worth . trust me --it's funny . very funny . i'm almost ashamed that i laughed out loud so much . the only real problem is that it all falls apart in the end

 and secretly hope for a return to our past . a time many call safer 
 and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale . one key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla . two girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter 
 and see him work with three other ambulance men : larry ( john goodman ) 
 and see it if you like holding on to your seat-handles real tight during a movie . in fact 
 and seedy hostelries trying to stay alive and out of trouble . mcdonald is a newcomer and a promising one at that 
 and seeing them together is a real treat . they both do a great job at smoothly and naturally becoming their characters 
 and seeing this movie it's not hard to see why . 
 and seems much longer . length is everything in films . if you can nail down the perfect timing and pace 
 and seems to caress his blue eyes 
 and self-centeredness that marks the character . it's easy to see why she surrenders to humbert : she loves the attention 
 and self-discovery .

 and self-serving 
 and sells them bit by bit . he meets vivian ( roberts ) on hollywood way when he asks her for directions to beverly hills . asking her what her name is

 and seth 
 and seth green ) are the most interesting part of this film because they're 
 and several audience members got up and left at that point . the frequent sex is one of the film's few flaws as the titillation is overdone and at times completely unrelated to anything else going on in the film . to toback's credit 
 and several close-ups of garofalo's winning smile . the strange thing is that it works . garofalo's charm and the irish scenery could carry the thinnest of stories 
 and several mine workers 
 and several others 
 and several sequences fall flat . subtle and not-quite-subtle allusions are made ( a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall ) 
 and several words and phrases which will never make it to commercial network tv . this one's worth catching before it comes out on video . you could probably still see it at a second-run

 and she begins to fall in love with vincent/jerome . gattaca is one of the best science fiction films i have seen in a long time . only two other intelligent science fiction films have come out in the past two years ( contact and the arrival ) and gattaca will rank among them . unfortunately 
" and she begins to turn things upside down . "" beloved "" acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story . most of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic "
 and she begins to visit the child in the hospital 
 and she believes that his soul has crossed over to this boy . fate then works in mysterious ways 
 and she denies him . . . sorta . we then learn 
 and she ends up driving off the side of the road and hitting a tree 
 and she gets the first glimpse of the fated ship in 80 years . as the memories come flooding back 
 and she has convinced herself she did the right thing . of course 
 and she has submitted another charming performance . still 
 and she has the always great liam neeson as her costar 
 and she has the richest and most powerful men in the republic throwing themselves at her feet 
 and she is one of the sweetest 
" and she is perfectly cast as the prolific "" aunt alexandria "" character "
 and she is perpetually cooking up strange delicacies 
 and she is radiant in her few scenes . finally 
 and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent--samuel l . jackson 
 and she isn't sure what to do with him . moore desperately wants to believe that goldberg has contacted swayze 
 and she looks at him with lust 
 and she makes a good mole : fast with her fists and good-looking . saki eventually takes the assignment 
 and she never gets this tranisition right . so 
 and she never gives into his cassanova-ness until the finale . thank god again . in every bond film 
 and she pulls off the scared-out-of-her-wits female lead without the camp the other actors put into their roles . overall 
 and she should always remember that . when annie's eldest son is involved in a fight at school 
 and she succeeds . birdee is still very upset about the entire episode with bill 
 and she tolerates his presence 
 and she was . she was also build to be one of the most luxurious 
 and she was truly happy . a few years after high school 
 and she's happy to oblige . this isn't as meaty a role for pfieffer as sharon stone's was in casino 
 and she's not charmed by him . at least at first . one day fletcher comes under the attention of some shadowy characters 
 and she's only in a small part of it . oh well . and there are always the big henchmen 
 and she's quite fun to just plain watch . marg helgenberger is immensely better this time around 
 and she's still meg ryan . which is what this movie boils down to . it's pure confection . all the bits about the godfather 
 and shimmering fields of wheat--all are resplendent in cinematographer robert richardson's viewfinder . veteran english composer john barry was originally signed to score the film but left the project which is a pity 
 and should be fine for most teenagers . 
" and should not be seen by anyone under 14 or more . this film contains extreme profanity ( over 130 "" f "" words and a collection of others ) . but beyond being bad in a tasteless type way "

 and signs on with pfcs 
 and similarly duke's world is composed of the artificial 
 and simply obtain them to fill such holes of loss and greed . others search for a happier time and place 
 and since the film is entitled 
 and since they are portrayed so realistically 
 and since we care about smith's likeable protagonist 
 and sinker . the movie stars tom hanks and meg ryan as two somewhat unhappy new yorkers who meet in an aol online chat room and quickly become close friends

 and six theatrical trailers ( called thecatrical trailers . . . get it ? it's funny ! ) for stuart little and five other columbia tristar releases : the adventures of elmo in grouchland 
 and slinky dog ( jim varney ) . while in captivity 
 and slowly she is suffering a nervous breakdown . meanwhile 
 and so are her friends 
 and so begins a passionate 
 and so do the two films in question 
 and so does much of the luster of the film . the songs by stephen flaherty and lynn ahrens ( the latter of whom holds a special place in my and many others' hearts for her enduring work on abc's schoolhouse rock ! ) become increasingly forgettable 
 and so frequently 
 and so is dillon ( while continuing to prove his inability to age to the whole wide wondering world ! ! ) . sprinkle the story with a bunch o' shots of alligators peeking through the swamp waters 
 and so it is pretty safe to say it isn't for those who are only a fan of action movies 
 and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found 
 and so on and so forth . the locations are not all computer-generated sets 
 and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop . okay 
 and so should anyone who enjoys being floored by the best cg animation ever put to film . you'd be living in a fantasy world of your own if you expected much more . 
 and so successful 
 and so the viewer is left to try to piece together what is actually happening . it has been more than thirty years since the last great roman epic was made . in reviving the genre 
 and so we let this small detail slide . but some of the technical details are awkward 
 and soap 
 and socially . still 
 and society in general 
 and sold their sexuality to wealthy men for the privilege of wining and dining with the elite . a courtesan was not a mere prostitute ; they were afforded a special place in society 
 and solid . really though 
 and solid comedic acting 
 and some are just plain bad . but for the most part 
 and some brilliant pyrotechnic fight scenes make soldier a fun saturday afternoon matinee movie . like event horizon 
 and some even become them . however 
 and some fun 
 and some good acting 
 and some good supporting work along with it . christopher eccleston ( slightly resembling richard edson with his new look and dumb expression ) plays jude wonderfully 
 and some imaganitive death . for a schwarzenegger movie 
 and some liberties have been taken 
 and some nasty 
 and some nudity . . ( a mild r rating ) starring : rob schneider 
 and some of charles' survival techniques seem possible 
 and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting . deceiver has the power to grab an audience . unfortunately 
 and some of the effects ( the face in the water 
 and some of the finest actors of the 1970's . the plot 
 and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper-thin at times . however 
 and some of them think their ideas are a lot more profound than they really are . the opening monologue 
 and some of this might have been better toned down 
 and some offensive remarks . as a film by itself 
 and some partial nudity . the film is definitely aimed at a more adult audience . some will find the plot distracting . some will find the visuals absolutely glorious . and some will find both . the only real problem with the film 
 and some parts do lag . the charm of the characters do help these moments 
 and some parts just seem to drag . while its running time is already a short 94 minutes 
 and some pop culture references so cleverly placed 
 and some rather sadistic moments ( these warriors 
 and some significant ones are the opening one 
 and some stilted conversation leads to their first 
 and some superb acting by a cast consisting almost exclusively of non-actors ( special note is to be made of cecilia fong sing lee

 and sometimes he made a second choice . either way 
 and sometimes hears their voices : particularly haunting is an asthmatic 18-year old girl named rose 
 and sometimes it turns out to be subtle and truly touching . one sequence that stands out is when judith is at a restaurant by herself 
 and sometimes it's absolutely riotous . but the laughs are hollow . . . because the story just sits there like a 7-10 split . 
 and sometimes peculiar shooting angles could contribute to an impression that first time feature film director shane meadows is not quite ready for such a large scale project . around the middle of the film though 
" and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series . medak has also mastered the wonderful "" jump ! "" moments "

 and soon 
 and soon after chow is allowed to ease into his normal routine . as well as chow is serviced by the replacement killers 
 and soon becomes one herself . besides 
 and soon enough 
 and soon enough john is chased all over town by a murderous army of pale people in black trench-coats 
 and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism 
 and soon the both of them are competing for her affections . there's something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly 
 and soon the production ( which later becomes romeo and juliet ) is set to be performed . shakespeare in love is an amazingly good film 
 and soon the tables are turned . when they both hit adulthood 
 and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle $500

 and sparks somehow begin to fly . sure

 and specifically 
 and spencer played a police detective in cop land . with the level of acting 
 and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends

 and stars mike mcglone and burns himself as the aforementioned brothers ( only two this time ) . also in the mix once again is maxine bahns 
 and starts a relationship with james ( john hannah ) 
 and starts making erotic movies . in the movie business 
" and steal virtually every scene they're in . be sure to stick around for their post-credits conversation . "" chicken run "" avoids the pitfall of many kids' movies by not being particularly preachy or heavy-handed in getting its message across . there's a lot of good stuff here "
 and steals a lot of scenes . out of the four major players 
 and steals nearly every scene he's in . don cheadle is appropriately sinister as a violent ex-con who may or may not be teaming up with foley . albert brooks is enjoyable as a white collar criminal who talks too much for his own good . out of the cast 
 and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights . it's fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat 
 and stegman ( david paymer ) 
 and steve martin and martin short are very good 
 and stick him with an lapd office with a big mouth- of course 
" and still gives the amazing visual technology of "" antz "" at least a worthy contender . the characters are also nicely realized - though watered-down for broad consumption "
 and stinky pete 
 and stolen car trouble come into play ; then we see the story of two gay movie actors ( played by scott wolf and jay mohr ) who deal with a cop's strange insurance presentation and hitting a girl ( sara ) with their car ; and 
 and strains his relationship with his wife 
 and strange requests 
 and strength 
 and strive to ascertain it through correction and discipline . one of the film's few missteps hits when it fails to actively portray some of the unfavorable consequences that can result from such promiscuous behavior 
 and style . if it weren't for their talent and savvy 
 and succeeds 
 and succeeds in creating exciting and invigorating shoot outs . on that same note however 
 and successfully manages to avoid most of his husbandly duties . for a long time charlotte misreads the attraction between humbert and her daughter . following the death of charlotte 
 and such . ask them what they've been doing lately 
 and suddenly helen manages to squeeze her way into the train as the doors close . from here on out 
 and sure 
 and sure enough it's a serial killer on the other line 
 and surprisingly 
 and surreal drama . as i was watching the film 
 and surrealistic . chris is a doctor and loves annie more than life itself . they also have two children 
 and suspected you were not on earth 
 and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie's end . on this advice 
 and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions . by no means has he developed a project of similar popularity - gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks - but the winning idea remains the same . simon birch is a different look at a different life 
 and swim for his life . this makes for an action movie full of jet skis 
 and taken to the hospital 
 and takes only an hour and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion 
 and takes the original face of sean archer . thus for the majority of the movie 
 and takes up residence in hogarth's house as a lodger . meanwhile 
 and talks with his coat hood covering his head . stan a regular 
 and teen angst . and its an arctic thanksgiving weekend in connecticut where these things all come together 
 and telescopes are some of his favorite toys . when he is old enough to accept his leadership 
 and tells them that the ants need twice the food by the end of summer 
 and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of post-cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck . his ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here 
 and tense . the atmosphere is explosive 
 and terrence stamp . the last steve martin film i saw 
 and terrorists . all people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness . however 
 and testimony from mallory's begrudging ex-husband 
 and thank heavens it doesn't . there's no way to relinquish the selfishness of society 
 and thanksgiving is quickly approaching . hollywood released a slew of horror and horror-related movies right before and closely after halloween 
 and that adds a dimension to the film which in this humble reviewers opinion makes it worth seeing 
 and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake . i was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was . i've always believed that movies are very powerful 
 and that films that entertained you were good 
 and that goes a long way towards the fun - even at the hokey times 
 and that he complicates things . mariano is a don juan with the equivalent of a girl in every port . here it's a lover in every town 
 and that he may now be out to get moore . in order to reach moore 
 and that he wanted the movie to be more of a study in human behavious . however 
 and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up . of course 
 and that is a feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie 
 and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot . in doing so 
 and that is all the fantastical elements of the story . there is no fairy god mother or anything even remotely of that nature . after the fantastical elements are stripped away what is left is a realistic believable rendition of the cinderella story and an interesting love story at the least . . unlike in the fairy tale 
" and that is crucial that the mib find it before the "" bug "" does . barry sonnenfeld "
 and that is incredibly funny . one of the best parts about the dinner game ( besides that cool looking animation that showcases the titles and credits for the film ) is the fact that while it's called the dinner game 
" and that is intriguing . i rate the film an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high + 2 on the -4 to + 4 scale . [there is one piece of sloppiness few people but me would notice . at one point we clearly see arnold's desk calendar say "" jan 16 tues . "" a quick mental calculation told me that combination could occur in 1945 and then not again until 1951 . the events had to take place in 1946 or 1947 . a possible date could be obtained from any world almanac . ] "
 and that is that the wings of the dove almost fits the story line of a film noir . a couple conspires to cheat someone out of their money so they can live happily ever after . their involvement in the deception makes each less attractive to the other 
 and that is the visuals . the animation is a little ragged and not nearly as fluid as disney work 
 and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments . 
 and that is why reversal of fortune is so good . 
 and that keeps us distanced 
 and that means kid-pleasing effects must plaster the screen . sadly 
 and that of the evil step mother 
 and that she is now being haunted by mary's ghost . norman 
 and that she was . finally 
 and that spirituality shines through . it's enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins . my religion is movies . when the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine 
 and that the giant needs food 
 and that the gun he pulled out was definitely not man-made . he has edwards identify the gun 
 and that will counterbalance the severity of this feature . bob bloom is the film critic at the journal and courier in lafayette 
 and that winning is not everything . of course 
 and that's a good thing . the chamber 
 and that's a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead . what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny's school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny . the other performances are all terrific 
 and that's a lot more than i can say about deep impact 
 and that's a shame because she brings so much to this movie . emotion . sadness . strength . watching the strong sethe 
 and that's about it . ) . the assortment of high-profile supporting actors 
 and that's certainly what this film should be 
 and that's important . the city backdrops that line all the scenes as elwood travels through chicago during the first half of the movie add to that feeling 
 and that's no accident--she truly _is_ anastasia 
" and that's not necessarily because of the three-hour running time . "" beloved "" is challenging to watch "
 and that's not so bad 
 and that's not surprising 
 and that's only one of the reasons it's such a fun watch . the movie lights up with an aging senator visited by nsa deputy chief thomas reynolds ( jon voight ) . reynolds wants a new communications act passed to allow the government free reign in the use of surveilance equipment 
 and that's something that just has to be commended these days 
 and that's the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film . tarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments ( and slang terms ) 
" and that's the precise allure of "" rounders . "" it ultimately matters not that a few of our tour guides feel partially-realized or that the journey itself is cluttered with sites we've seen before "
 and that's the secret of their charm . they're always entertaining 
" and that's what "" jude "" is . sure "
" and that's what makes it such great fun to watch . not since the old "" mr . bill "" skits on "" saturday night live "" has torture and mutilation been such a joy to watch . people were laughing out loud every time a body was severed in half or a head was viciously decapitated . perhaps it brings back fond memories of the severities we inflicted upon our sisters' barbie dolls as young children . with the actors resembling ken and barbie so closely "
 and that's when the real fun begins . critique : likeable comedy with a few extremely funny scenes 
 and that's who should see it . it's definitely not for those under 18 ! did i mention that this film is rated r ? however 
 and that's why there's no shortage of movies about this subject . the best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski 
 and the acting from fraser and weisz isn't half bad either . the action is pretty intense ( favorite scene : the sandstorm ) and there are a few shocking scenes just to jolt you horror-loving folks as well . no 
 and the acting is solid . the best thing about the script is the ending which doesn't end with the normal high-strung action sequence 
 and the acting is stunning 
 and the action scenes are awe-inspiring . the musical score to the film is enjoyable 
 and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting 
 and the actors play wonderfully off each other . now the real question : how's the action ? fortunately 
 and the actresses who play them aren't bad aswell . sevigny delivers an honest performance 
 and the adorable 
 and the adventure and charm holds right up to the last reel . screenwriters john eskow 
" and the adventures that they fall into are somewhat thrilling ( i will also admit that "" somehow "" they got me to semi-tear up near the conclusion of this picture . . . . very odd . . . . . ) . overall "
 and the aforementioned babboons . but 
 and the animated monkey that joins the family halfway through the flic is mucho cool ) 
 and the anonymous townfolk paid extras . people watch truman's life 24 hours a day 
 and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence . while the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes -- invoking pseudo-asian references to items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary 
 and the audience gets to know them pretty well 
 and the audience is left feeling relieved rather than angry when he is killed by the bad guys . despite these criticisms 
 and the baby turns out to be a vile little creature that looks something like e . t . after thalidomide . the news about the pregnancy 
 and the bartender in dumb and dumber . he is old friends with the farrelly brothers from college 
 and the beautiful scenery of vancouver . it's a movie of weddings 
 and the best movie among the ever-growing list of muppet movies . the muppet movie tells the story of how our hero 
 and the big clown ) 
 and the big fat caterpillar . all of these bugs have more than a token personality 
 and the blood of animals is not enough . eventually 
 and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence . now 
 and the camera sweeps over red mountains . we see two figures looking over a barren 
 and the cartoon slapstick doesn't get in the way . the mcalisters 
 and the casts 
 and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not to fall in love with every one of them . ginger is perfect 
 and the chases ( in the street 
 and the check remains unclaimed . enter jackie o'shea ( ian bannen ) and michael o'sullivan ( david kelly ) 
 and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings . but it does have its flaws . the smallest problem is that culkin doesn't act very well . as i said before 
 and the cia ) . he takes a look at the complexities inherent when so many secrets and lies are involved . the palestinian community in 1998 new york is treated exactly as japanese americans were during world war ii . there are concentration camps and unlawful interments 
 and the city of rome in general . the visuals are breathtaking and voluminous 
 and the classic silent film version of the doyle . jp2 was an adventure 
 and the climactic sequence is allowed to play out for a bit too long 
 and the climax delivers a superb emotional payoff . unfortunately 
 and the color of money all epitomized this master of smooth talk and wily ways . but the successes of all of his past films and all of their cons have one common denominator : a memorable and talented supporting cast . in the hustler 
 and the comic timing required for some of the film's latter scenes is superb . richard dreyfuss is terrific as the hapless professor who soon loses control of his own imaginary tribe . jenna elfman's position as a romantic lead seems a bit forced at times 
 and the competition between brothers spawns . vincent has a dream to fly a solo-flight around the titan 
 and the complications that inevitably arise 
 and the concept is excellently realized . a particular fight scene in a chinese office 
" and the consequences are dire . bresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of men's hearts and minds . "" lancelot of the lake "" is filled with his particular trademarks : a stripped-down "
" and the consequences thereof . what separates "" rounders "" from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end . please visit chad'z movie page at : http : //members . aol . com/chadpolenz - over 200 new and old films reviewed in depth "
 and the cornucopia of drug-ravaged scenes filling your own intoxicated system with ideas of anarchy 
 and the correct personal crisis . woody 
 and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable 
 and the cyborsuit 
 and the danish august turns in his most accomplished english-language work 
 and the decisions they are often forced to make that will shape their lives forever . everything in the small texan town of west canaan revolves around the local high school team . disillusioned fathers live vicariously through their son's achievements on the football field 
" and the decisions they make . but perhaps this is all to be expected . "" wonder boys "" is a movie all about making choices and the consequences of avoiding them "
 and the depressive mood the picture has 
 and the dialogue isn't funny enough to make it a comedy . in having trouble to characterize the movie as a whole 
 and the dialogue reasonable . if you liked movies like ed's next move 
 and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach . but 
 and the dialogue tends towards the hackneyed . now that the elements are in place : modern special effects and stunt work 
 and the dogged inspector bumstead ( william hurt ) . is john a murderer 
 and the dot-com era embodies that perfectly . beneath a mound of bankruptcy paperwork lies the remains of a former dot-com darling 
 and the dude eventually finds himself in hot water with cops 
 and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing . instead of seeing people get bonked on the head 
 and the emotions aren't put forth in a sentimental and overbearing way . in fact 
 and the ending credits roll . the sweet hereafter runs 1 : 50 . it is rated r for mature themes 
 and the ending doesn't match the promise of the first half . still 
" and the ending is particularly incredulous . what is important is the way "" scary movie "" subverts its source material "
 and the ending is shocking as it's a definite work of dystopian propaganda 
 and the ending was certainly not much of a barn-burner 
 and the endless fields of snow in antarctica ( actually somewhere in north america . ) make this fantastic film feel more real . ward russell's cinematography is very good . the overall look is dark and ominous 
 and the engaging characters captivate the audience with their spell . i'll not say more except that the ending is perfect and a bit of a surprise . the house of yes runs a blazing fast 1 : 25 . it is rated r for sexual situations and conversations 
 and the ensemble cast couldn't be better . each character is completely individual 
 and the ensemble cast works well together . once the film hits its stride 
 and the ensuing trials that finished off poor oscar 
 and the entertainment industry are so closely related 
 and the entire voyage through the contraption is all the more fascinating because of it . nowhere is this more true than in the movie's outstanding climax 
" and the erroneous association of the term "" schizophrenic "" with charlie's split personalities . although the term "" schizo "" is used on occasion in the film "
 and the ethical quagmire 
 and the events start spinning like a windmill in stormy weather 
 and the eventual conclusion was ultimately more satisfying . all in all 
 and the expected wildean thoughts and epigrams . but concurrently as well as exponentially 
 and the family heads off without him . it's interesting that 
 and the father is too wrapped up in his work to notice the rest of his family ( ever heard that one before ? yawn ! ) . the acting is ok 
 and the feeling of pessimism can't be washed away even by ironic happy end . travis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation 
 and the film = merely tells us jesus is great 
 and the film as a whole is unforgettable--perhaps because it is so disturbing . what makes it so unsettling is the francie's overall wink-wink yet matter-of-fact attitude about everything 
 and the film begins . . . total recall is a typical sci-fi film wrapped around an intresting ( if far fetched ) plot . quaid 
 and the film could've simply focused on their romance the entire running time and be successful . but i know that's not the only story irwin winkler wants to tell . this film is also about how a blind man copes with restored sight . there is nothing wrong with this 
 and the film depicts the senseless loss of life and futile carnage of the war . the thin red line is almost a profound and almost poetic meditation on the nature of war and how it poisons man's soul . there's nothing noble about this bloody conflict 
" and the film did have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the "" fake "" jackal met with the "" real "" jackal's girlfriend without much retrospection on her part "
 and the film doesn't work . everything here looks bright and explosive -- from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers 
 and the film ends rather abruptly . which is true 
 and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny . in the present-time of the film 
 and the film has more rubber logic than most 
 and the film leaves it up to us to make this call . both have things the other wants and vice versa 
 and the film resides snugly inside a g rating . children will probably have more questions about the restrictive ancient customs than of the slaughter of armies . it's ironic that a film concerned with bucking tradition is hampered because of its strict adherence to disney tradition . if the filmmakers had the guts to lessen the humor 
 and the film suffers when griffiths is off-screen . muriel's tormenters 
 and the film unfolds with lots of slapstick humour and energy . the pace picks up in the second half during the frantic search for the perfect suicidal room mate . performances are more than adequate for this type of film 
 and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks . cole attracts the dead for reasons unknown 
 and the film's omnipresent hip-hop soundtrack strongly supports this . but toback keeps things from becoming too serious ; by moving from story to story as quickly as he does 
" and the filmmakers blew a perfectly good opportunity to add some suspense to the picture by using the "" rival car thief "" plot line . as it stands "
 and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor 
 and the filmmakers imply that these would-be kings are seeing more action than they ever did during wartime . barlow is eventually locked in a dank room and wired up to a shocking device . his interrogator lost his family to the bombs 
 and the final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to a literal scrap-pile sums up the entire film in one moment . however 
 and the final product certainly proves this . - copyright 1999 by dustin putman dustin putman's film haven  
 and the final sequence is nothing more than a showdown between the one ( relatively ) innocent character and the only one of the murderers left alive . that said 
 and the first battle begins . it seems that for me and thousands of people like me 
" and the first of two "" the sky is falling "" flicks to hit screens this year ( the other being this coming july's armageddon "
 and the first two don't count . this whole thing sounds like a bad troma ( tm ) film 
 and the fit is perfect . the dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles 
 and the friendly inhabitants are smiling gleefully as they skip down the street to an upbeat tune . enter the foursome of cartman 
 and the fun goes on from there . this movie is a lot of fun . it is comedic on two levels 
 and the funny lines 
 and the gears inch ever closer toward violence . during the september massacres of 1792 
" and the genre essays 'do you know kung fu "" original theatrical website and sampler trailers . film rating- * * * some may be disappointed with the matrix . i'll tell you i was . i sat there and sat there and sat there waiting for something to happen . now wait wait "
 and the ghost disappears . but when they return one day from going out 
 and the ghost remains 
" and the girl is my daughter . "" "
 and the girls meet and befriend the magical creatures that live in the forest nearby . but there's more to this film than that . my neighbor totoro gives us sort of a window into japanese culture 
 and the gladiatorial games as a conduit for revenge are all familiar plot elements . nonetheless 
 and the goofy owen 
 and the gorgeous scene with muriel window-shopping beautifully illustrates the wonder that marriage has for her . the glaring pastel colours worn by the performers is an interesting touch . muriel's wedding features a fine performance by toni collette and a charming 
 and the greedy trade federation has used it's armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo . we soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboo's ruler 
 and the guy even won a pulitzer prize for his play glengarry glen ross . with that said 
 and the headquarters for clamp international . of course 
 and the hippie movement has left behind quite a few wash-outs 
 and the hopeful coming of the dawn . his struggle with amnesia is both figuratively and literally the struggle of all mankind ( at least in his world ) . when we finally see the big picture of the movie's world 
 and the household's introduction to meat and television . there are definitely some highlights sprinkled throughout 
 and the hughes brothers 
 and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy . the scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things 
 and the humor occasionally falls flat . however 
 and the humor only serves to further augment bateman's dementia . apart from bale's standout performance 
 and the hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved . but why does such a tremendous feat of eye candy have to be weighted down with a problematic story 
" and the implication is that many more die off-screen . but this very fact -- that much of bateman's crime spree is referred to only in passing -- makes it clear that the movie is less concerned about his deeds than about bateman himself . the killings themselves are alternately comical and dispassionate . there is none of the frenzied bloodlust of "" natural born killers "" ( another good film about murderers "
" and the inevitable wedding from hell . "" very bad things "
 and the influence to seemingly do whatever they want . governments kowtow to them 
 and the inspiration of true love with noblewoman viola de lesseps ( gwyneth paltrow ) 
 and the intense scrutiny of a rival anthropologist 
 and the key character of a trigger-happy pharmacist ( stephen lang ) is highly unbelievable . but these missteps do not blunt the power of tunney's bravura turn 
 and the kids are neither shoved into the background nor allowed to steal the show . one word of caution 
 and the kids are ripe for all manner of trouble with show-and-tell games 
 and the king wishes to have kevin as his son . but the group of bandits find kevin and transport onto the deck of the titanic . meanwhile 
 and the la amistad 
" and the lad would not be a wise replacement for 39-year old star performer jack "" cap "" rooney ( dennis quaid ) . egos are a big influence on all this "
 and the last hour kept us entertained . but with a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes 
 and the late j . t . walsh ( breakdown 
 and the leisurely plot allow meadows to dwell exclusively on these relationships without distracting the audience . ironically 
 and the love she has for her husband . her meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic - it defines who she is 
 and the love story comes out on top . a friend of my mother's is a compulsive collector of odd trivia . one night she came back after a cab ride with six photocopied pages of closely-packed conspiracy theory gibberish 
 and the main suspect is one vincent freeman . the only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman . vincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love . however 
 and the map 
 and the mechanism of the disaster is assembled . we meet all the important people . . . toxic waste disposal truck drivers ; a young 
 and the minor subplot revolving around his ex-wife and son is very moving . the comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare ( who plays a crazy russian astronaut ) is nifty 
 and the more i think about it 
 and the more questionable aspects of the movement have turned ugly and left casualties such as duke to drift in a sea of drugs and disillusionment . in many ways 
 and the more serious apt pupil 
 and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off ( way to go 
 and the movie . one of the first scenes is of the studio light falling ; there was no token scene of truman's idyllic life before it falls apart 
 and the movie borrows its story from the first and part of the second volumes . shinji wada 
 and the movie goes on for about 20 minutes too long . on the slick side 
 and the movie keeps unfolding with eccentric developments and devices 
 and the movie limps it way through a jetsons-style future setting . now banished to a fate worse than ordinary reruns 
 and the mpaa and censorship . but it's far from too late 
 and the music is great . maybe it's not nearly as hilarious as the classic first one 
 and the musical that is being put on for the big event . the play is being directed by corky st . clair ( christopher guest 
 and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest . like most of his other films 
 and the next thing you know 
 and the next you'll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary's apartment . one of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller . he is perfectly cast in the role of ted 
 and the number of long encounters which take place 
 and the object of his affection is a woman who works in the justice department -- alice sutton 
 and the obligatory sex scene ( don't forget 
 and the occasional lump in the throat . the film opens with a non-verbal cue to anna's stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actress's appearances in films and at premieres - coming out of limousines 
 and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon and minnie driver ( who became romantically linked while making this film ) translates effectively to the movie -- the will/skylar relationship is electric . likewise 
 and the old 
 and the ones they do have aren't memorable . the best of the bunch 
 and the only place she can really go to feel happy is to hear one of her favorite singers 
 and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor . although an extremely fine and mature picture 
 and the originality doesn't strike me nearly as much as it could have . open your eyes is the story of cesar ( eduardo noriega ) 
 and the other presents the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 66 : 1 . both versions feature choices of either dolby surround or dolby digital 5 . 1 audio . both versions also contain the following extras ( and hang in there with me here . . . there's a lot of them ) : a full length audio commentary track by director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson 
 and the other pro basketball players featured in the film 
 and the other who's a reappearing threat to the relationship . the former is charlotte 
 and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two-fold challenge--not only somehow resurrect ripley 
 and the overall look and feel were also way above average . you really felt like you were in the future 
 and the pace is a little slow until joe escapes into la . characterisation is pretty one dimensional 
 and the pacing of a rollercoaster . hopkins plays don diego de la vega 
 and the parting of the red sea have to be seen to be believed . kudos to the animators . the vocal talent is also very good . val kilmer does a fine job as moses ( although he doesn't sing ) and ralph fiennes is superb as rameses ( and he _does_ sing . ) sandra bullock and jeff goldblum are great 
 and the performance which follows 
 and the phantom menace is no exception . i loved sebulba 
 and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah . unfortunately 
 and the pilot head off to find him 
 and the plot is revealed 
" and the pond behind his home . "" the gift "" may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level "
 and the poseidon adventure were big hits . there was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane - a series that spanned the entire decade . and so 
 and the previews looked somewhat bland . much to my surprise 
 and the problem i think with each of these films is that each film is too obsessed with its message to ever be really satisfying 
" and the proceedings generally feel as though they've been lifted out of an uncommonly bizarre episode of "" law and order "" . but even this is energised by excellent performances from caviezel and particularly quaid . "" frequency "" lives or dies on the conviction of their father/son relationship "
 and the professor's lovely daughter 
 and the pulsating cacophony of street noises on the audio track . it's too much . in his eager passion to fill amores perros with explosive imagery 
 and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable . the only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her character's upbringing . simply by judgment of her gait 
 and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the film's length . contrary to popular trend 
 and the quieter aspects of the plot are not trivialised . perhaps as a result of this 
 and the quintessential slice-and-dice classic halloween . she was also quite memorable in john carpenter's overlooked atmospheric ghost story the fog . it's good to see her back in her element again . in virus 
 and the raps are actually well produced and humorous 
 and the rat's named splinter . i don't know why . in the course of this movie 
 and the real truth behind the grateful dead . make sure listen closely throughout the film 
" and the real world ? "" open your eyes is essentially about our dreams "
 and the reason for making it 
 and the recent murders . the most complex self-reference i saw ( this should be an olympic event ) was the scene where gale weathers was asking questions at a press conference . the rest of the press was watching and videotaping weathers . the other survivors from scream were watching and videotaping the press . the audience was watching the whole 
 and the red light and steam coming out of sewers give it surreal 
 and the regulars seem interested in what they're doing . although it is another medical carry on movie and some of the jokes are borrowed from previous movies 
 and the relationship between jerry and alice is like a mutant version of a screwball comedy where the society dame is pestered by the resourceful grocery boy . it is 
 and the remainder of the film is filled with useless melodrama that no one could care less about . a gang war has consumed the bay area of oakland . the two factions are issak's ( delroy lindo ) african americans 
 and the remaining people ( about 7 or 8 ) are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth . of course 
 and the rest is history . what sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material 
 and the result is a character who exists in shadows and low shots 
 and the result is a draw . according to the film 
 and the result is an incredibly smart thriller set against a dramatic story 
 and the result is very pleasing to the eye : particularly in the climactic scenes 
 and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout . two girls and a guy has an agile 
 and the resulting game lead the pair on a strange adventure in a world where individuality doesn't exist 
 and the returned gale weathers ( courtney cox arquette ) and dewey riley ( david arquette ) . at the same time 
 and the reward is a virtually guaranteed helping of hearty laughs . steve martin generates the power behind bowfinger 
 and the riffs on star wars happen early and often ) 
 and the roles of pleasure and sin in a high-cultured society 
 and the running ( homeric ? ) gag of the movie is that whoami becomes his name . ( the tribe 
 and the running gag of his body parts constantly fall off is amusing 
 and the scene drags on for 10 terrible minutes of film . the true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound . the film slows down to a drag . sheen seems forever captured by a madman 
 and the scope of some visuals 
 and the score 
 and the score is brilliant 
" and the screen fills with the message : "" watch out ! a baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues . "" beyond the political aspects "
 and the screenplay by karey kirkpatrick slips in several references which only the grown-ups will get -- the chickens meet in hut 17 
 and the screenplay makes the major mistake of presenting webber's character as a threat to virgil and amy's romance . this guy is the most pathetic and pointless character since john pankow in the object of my affection . any scene he is in shakes the credibility of the entire film . another misconceived character comes in the form of virgil's father . he left virgil many years ago when he couldn't find a cure for his blindness . when he learns of virgil's restored sight 
 and the screenwriter 
" and the script does not grind to a halt to exploit it . nothing in "" wonder boys "" feels staged or melodramatic ; realism seethes from its characters "
 and the search for bobby fisher ( zaillian's first directorial job ) about a child who was a chess prodigy . all those titles 
 and the sets echo a sense of shallow misery . and the sequence of all the high-level workers doing their jobs has a kind of gilliam-esque feel to it 
 and the sex they have 
 and the sexes . the plot alone could make his great uncle walt thaw out 
 and the sexual revolution is in full bloom . so are the thick shag carpets 
 and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm's egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan . she orders a huge pie-making machine 
 and the sky goes on forever . the characters continue that turn : our two leads are simon birch ( ian michael smith ) and joe wenteworth ( joseph mazzello ) . simon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital 
 and the slapstick he performed was just distracting . his head gets caught in an electronic field 
 and the social and economic divisions caused by race and class . beatty 
 and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film . walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam 
 and the sound is muted . as soon as this artistic method began 
 and the soundtrack . this things alone probably make dark city worth watching . it may not be the best film of the year 
 and the sparks begin to fly . ( one of the great touches in the film is how blake 
 and the special effects are nothing short of the best ( and most plentiful ) to ever be caught on film . the vast digitized worlds and sheer imagination that was applied to this project is astounding . the phantom menace is a delectable feast for the senses 
 and the special effects at the end of the film aren't too bad either . there's also a good soundtrack running through 
 and the spoons ( evelyn varden and walt spoon ) whose marriage has become a verbal vaudeville act . the only lapse is the movie's third act 
 and the story would be intact . but sandler instead brings a mature goodness to the character . he seems to really enjoy the people at weddings and treats them as though they were his own family . robbie hart ( sandler ) doesn't just sing at weddings ; he also gets the loners to join in and have fun 
" and the structuring of the "" on-again-off-again "" friendship at the film's center is fairly predictable . we know early on where these two characters are headed "
" and the subsequent extra-terrestrial "" transformation "" is another eye-catcher . even the late 80's special effects were okay . followed by the hidden ii in 1994 . little known facts : this film was kyle maclachlan's first non-david lynch foray into the world of feature films . his first two movie appearances were in lynch's wretched dune ( 4/10 ) and the sensational blue velvet ( 8 . 5/10 ) visit joblo's movie reviews  "" http : //www . microtec . net/~drsuess/ "
" and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background . "" gone with the wind "" "
 and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects and a very good music score by christopher young 
 and the surprises come from little character details . the film is quite talky and slow moving 
 and the surprisingly complex script keeps the viewer guessing while the laughable dialogue is full of cheesy lines undercutting the seriousness of the subject matter . my friend and i chuckled throughout the movie 
 and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day . the edge has the intelligence and smart characters 
 and the three are left to survive in the wilderness . director lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow 
 and the three principles - smith 
 and the thundering soundtrack . and the impending release of vampire hunter d : bloodlust has made me wet with anticipation . the original vampire hunter d was produced for video only in 1985 . its twisted violence 
" and the times were apparently "" a' changing "" in the states . johnny depp chews into his role like an overgrown child sucking on a chocolate lollipop . during the filming "
 and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant 
 and the top-notch script finds a good balance between drama and comedy . although its sheer placidness may work against it in such a crowded box office 
 and the tricks that our subconscious plays on us . while the film is clever and psychological 
 and the triptych of blue 
 and the twisted games we see medics engage in to pass the time . but it's the harsher images that stick in our minds 
 and the two are transported into the very fictional 
 and the two begin a kind of relationship 
 and the two soon form a close friendship . han must discover who the killers are before they decide to eliminate both he and trish as well . if this plot summary sounds a bit confusing that's because this is a rather confusing and convoluted movie . in case you're wondering 
 and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspense-filled action film with great stunts . the last half of the film is very well done . another thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise 
 and the voice of reason . because we know how everything comes out 
 and the warm cinematography of emmanuel lubezki . there is also the usual strong performance from the dependable hopkins . and pitt and forlani make a handsome 
 and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean 
 and the way in which it is delivered 
 and the whole mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief . sheen seems to adore this man 
 and the whole political process itself . in the week before the senate elections 
 and the whole story is sweet and cute . deuce bigalow ( rob schneider ) is your typically average guy : he cleans fish tanks for a living and gets an average of 10 bucks for it . though one might call him a loser 
 and the winslow boy display a roundness to mamet's innate abilities . and it's almost a crime to witness how all of that goes awry in his latest film 
 and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters 
 and the young buck has his attack dog . it sounds a little too neat - and it is 
 and their directorial debuts . in the seventies 
 and their dynamic is manifest . willis convinces us that he's a doctor 
 and their films reflect their genius .  they are likely to be remembered for . . . well 
" and their insecurities involved in making the decision to actually have sex . "" high art "
 and their leader gets killed by riffs . the remaining eight 
 and their pairing still ranks as one of screendom's most effervescently charming . for those eight of you who aren't familiar with the story 
 and their slow-witted pothead associate 
 and their sole purpose was to destroy us 
 and their songs underscore the film nicely-- certainly the coolest video a band can ask for . when our hero 
 and their teenage daughter lili ( li qinqin ) in beijing after 30 years of separation . fang brings his asian american wife grace ( sharon iwai ) and his college-aged son paul ( kelvin han yee ) along 
 and then adds even more to them . there are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen . and even though you think you may get tired of them 
 and then arrives a hunter 
 and then calls the cops . meanwhile 
 and then down like that 
 and then from another 
 and then from another .1
 and then goes over to join her own friends . as the woman sits down 
 and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny 
 and then hires a hit man to kill him 
 and then kill 
 and then laugh again . i laughed at dick ( todd louiso ) 
 and then lou 
 and then mentions that the answer to this compelling puzzle shall be revealed when we join sunny von bulow 
 and then must escape in the nick of time by flying away in a fighter jet while the co-pilot tries to strangle him and a terrorist in another jet tries to shoot him down ! this might sound like the kind of cliches films like this are notorious for ( over- ) using 
 and then prepares to film the movie without the star's knowledge . the actors confront ramsey on the street 
 and then presents an interesting scenario : if politics 
 and then pulls everything he thought he had as a security blanket away from him and watched what happened . the result was not only a film that was exciting and chilling 
 and then right into the show 
 and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back . she runs to the barn near by 
 and then sharply up this way 
 and then she carried her own movie 
 and then shrug it off as nothing 
" and then switch over to the next available receptacle . fbi agent ( mclachlan ) and local top cop ( nouri ) are charged with the capture of this "" thing "" before it's too late . critique : this fast-paced "
 and then the s * * * really hits the fan . the implant goes wrong 
" and then there are those who say that "" eraserhead "" isn't supposed to make sense . i'm with the second camp : if "" eraserhead "" made any sense at all "
 and then throwing the gun out in the back yard . the only reasonable suspect is willie 
 and then uses them ( though not quite as effectively ) . charles morse ( anthony hopkins ) is the main character 
 and then wants to find out what she told the cops . after she claims to have said nothing 
 and then you realize that you don't . acting is crucial to this film's success 
 and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy 500-like play by play . i liked the pod race ; it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension 
 and there are a few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans 
 and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movie . the journey to kurtz' camp is quite a ride 
 and there are more than a few decent supporting performances to enjoy 
 and there are patterns everywhere in nature 
 and there are plenty of laughs 
 and there are quite a few of them . as i mentioned before 
" and there are some great send-ups of human behaviour . one of my favourite scenes has black actress regina hall attending a showing of "" shakespeare in love "" . in a terrific pastiche of rude moviegoers ( and "
 and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles . at one point 
 and there are times when the storyline curves in preposterous directions . on more than one occasion 
" and there are various little subplots relating to these . unlike "" gun shy "" from earlier this year "
 and there are very small cameos from wilfrid brambell ( from 'steptoe and son' fame ) and peter butterworth . the jokes are mostly very funny 
" and there aren't any "" wes carpenter "" jokes this time . more importantly "
 and there is an occasional burst of violence . originally rated nc-17 in the united states 
 and there is not a clear-cut 
 and there is only one way he is going to come up with that much money that quickly : the same way antoine does . rob schneider is a member of the saturday night live ( snl ) class that produced stars like adam sandler ( who produced this movie ) 
 and there isn't a single sexy 
 and there isn't much in the way of drama to hold a viewer's attention . although i am unfamiliar with the play 
" and there just aren't ways to make car chases interesting anymore . it's all been done . the chase is also shot and edited in that "" jerry bruckheimer action sequence "" kind of way that leaves the audience wondering what specifically is going on in the scene . sure it's a car chase "
 and there must be a reason he's so small . joe doesn't quite buy it 
 and there the comedy truly picks up . franken wrote all of the characters not just as cliches or stereotypes 
 and there was clearly a lot of chemistry between the two . these joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast in the life styles that they have always known 
 and there was nothing to be done about it 
" and there was noticeable discomfort in his body language . returned in brosnan's eyes has some of the playfulness he demonstrated for so many years on tv's "" remington steele "" "
 and there's a mix-up of tapes . this of course puts him right in the path of an endless stream of punks 
 and there's barely a dull moment . however 
 and there's certainly a big audience for that . too bad he couldn't get tom stoppard to bail him out this time . 
 and there's more humor - and the turtles wear different colored masks - but otherwise 
" and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective . but that's the word that came to me right after viewing "" chicken run . "" no wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions "
 and therefore had to computer-generate the remaining 40 feet . could've fooled me and everyone else in the theater 
 and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations . he succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film . take 
 and therefore her values . aristocracy proves a glass house 
 and therefore must constantly evade a grim-looking assassin to be who's trailing him at every turn 
 and therefore spend all of his time in an office 
 and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs 
 and therefore we laugh . teenagers and jim carrey fans probably won't find an albert brooks movie very funny 
 and theresa russell ( real name : theresa paup ) seems to have lost her way in every which way possible . . . . ooooh 
 and these cultural exchanges are where the film's painless platitudes come to light . oddly 
 and these movies are now slowly making their way through second-run 
 and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter's ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) expose of a drug dealing ring . other plot details 
" and they agree to help under similar false pretenses . these bugs are an equally wonderful assortment to anything in "" toy story "" : foppish walking stick slim ( david hyde-pierce ) "
 and they almost become our friends . we like these guys for the sole reason that the film doesn't automatically judge them as the villains . they're also scary because we get the idea that they're not fully aware of the impact their jobs have on the world . it's as if they're obsessed with their jobs 
 and they are legible 
 and they are parked near a lake 
 and they are rather fun to watch . so 
 and they are rude to their girlfriends . of course 
 and they aren't funny enough to stand on their own . once the investigation is underway 
 and they collide with takeda . takeda is a yakuza protector 
 and they don't know that flick needs them to kill a bunch of grasshoppers 
 and they embrace it with a vehemence and a glee that other schlock-makers can't even come near . actually 
 and they end up in bed together . rick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked by her slightly psychotic father 
 and they even get to poke fun at speculation about their offscreen relationship . certain corporate idolaters are slammed mercilessly 
 and they had no children ) 
 and they have no idea who each other is . ny152 happens to be joe fox ( hanks ) 
 and they have the fastest selling album in playtone records history . the band is invited to appear in a feature film 
 and they have to hit the road . fuqua knows his hk action staples . the movie is saturated with highly choreographed violence . the whole movie glows and glitters : shattering glass 
 and they immediately find themselves stuck in a deserted paradise with few ideas on getting back to civilization . a series of unpleasant 
 and they know what to do and what not to do . the only character that seems a little cliched is the general ( george dzundza ) 
 and they must try to hide their affairs from their very naive parents . as they get older 
 and they never change their behavior for a quick 
 and they pass quickly . with smart dialogue 
 and they pay a homeless man to buy their tickets . while in the movie 
 and they provide enough chemistry for us to genuinely care for both . there is quite a bit of humor in this film 
 and they seem at home 
 and they spend their spare time scanning the obituaries 
 and they start to date . ramona hooks them up as good as she can 
 and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a half-million dollars . only through a series of clever twists 
 and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare . and 
 and they were greatly revered 
" and they weren't "" set-up jokes "" like your typical comedies either "
 and they wind up in his hotel room 
 and they would only be together for the sake of being together . mckellar gives a brilliant performance 
 and they would really have had something here . as it stands 
 and they'll more likely than not reply 
 and they're all doing this in the same area 
 and they're always making sure you're paying attention . this is incredibly annoying 
 and they're at it again with dueling bug movies 
 and they're delivered frequently and entertainingly . occasionally 
 and they're first in line to have the whole thing put on their heads . now they're going to try to clear their names 
 and they're fun ones at that . they tend to make a lot of jokes 
" and they're often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own . the really big thing about "" drunken master "" "
 and they're serious direction 
 and things are not working out well between jimmy and guy . will the band work it out 
 and things get even more crowded . . . so be prepared . 
 and things take a turn for the worst . pyle proves that not everyone is emotionally 
 and this ( these ) survivor ( s ) kill ( s ) the creature in the end . the creature in virus is an alien-energy-life-form-thingie creating all sorts of different biomechanical monsters to terrorize the crew of the doomed sea star . you'll recognize these creations right away if you're a sci-fi fan . tiny mechanical spiders from runaway . human-sized borg people from star trek : first contact . etc . to be honest 
 and this also plays on the motivations of the cast . but most importantly 
 and this contributes to long stretches of comparative tedium . there are also some really bizarre moments 
 and this film delivers gangbusters on that front . and yes . . . they have no wire-fu in this movie . . . i say again . . . no wire-work 
 and this film is one of the better ones of the better ones ! i'd recommend seeing it ! 
 and this film nearly reminded me of it . it doesn't have nearly as much wit ( a couple comical scenes 
 and this film proves that a movie doesn't necessarily require likable character to be extremely enjoyable . there's more fun 
 and this film was a hit in it's native spain . penelope cruz 
 and this girl 
 and this is a heavy credit to writers/directors andy and larry wachowski . i mean 
 and this is best exemplified by gerry 
 and this is its undoing . for 
 and this is no exception . although they're not really germane to the plot 
 and this is unfair because it can be done . clerks cronicles the day of a quick stop convience store clerk dante and his buddy randal next door who runs a bad video store . randal shows up and starts utterly pointless yet often hilarious results . did independent contractors get killed in the later of the star wars tilogy 
" and this it does very well . the "" father death "" mask "
 and this leads them to cross paths with the leader of the afore-mentioned group ( played by lance henriksen ) . * and * we get another murder-of-a-homeless scene . the vet who's killed this time is someone chance knew as a friend 
 and this live-action film as a whole is appealing 
 and this movie breaks the boundaries . instead of having heterosexual sex scenes 
 and this movie features van damme fighting 
 and this one easily gets you in the mindset for an entertaining ride . and what follows doesn't disappoint . . . cage turns in one of his good performances here ( he can easily go either way . . . good or bad . . . i don't know how he does that ) 
 and this one is a decent addition to the lot . forget the lame title and malcolm mcdowell's narration of the obvious plot points 
 and this performance is among her best . she has a natural ability to show how much she cares for someone without even having to say a word . val kilmer abandons his usual brooding 
 and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed . we get a sense that perhaps it's by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed . he weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original 14-year-old love 
 and this results in a heightened emotional punch when norton's isaacman has the opportunity to sway the supreme court judges . milos forman keeps the film moving - although it runs over two hours 
 and this results in several affecting and powerful scenes . there's an edginess to some of the sean/will therapy sessions 
 and this sorrow lets them draw closer to one another . her reservations towards temptation are laid bare and chow supplements the situations with his own reservations towards love for another person . the main issue with films that deal with an epic theme -- one that requires grandiose set constructions 
 and this story is missing the excellent 
 and this time around 
 and this time we have an almost-cameo by teri hatcher as carver's wife 
 and thornton wilder . karen arthur's direction is certainly no match for the great master 
" and those dogging "" waterworld "" ( prior to "" titanic "
 and those here do not disappoint . director samo hung ( who has a cameo role ) 
 and those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute . the pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes from elizabeth's final days and hours . the most intriguing of these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice-over by visually showing what really happened . moments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks . the movie 
 and those who could care less . it shouldn't come as any surprise that the acting 
 and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction . if i had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walks the line between drama and melodrama . it's too sentimental and uplifiting for a straight drama 
 and though i enjoy a thought-provoking drama as much as the next person 
 and though it essentially boils down to one mishap after another 
 and though the effects are seamless 
 and thought : maybe too much credit isn't nearly enough ! -----== posted via deja news 
 and threatens to unbalance the movie . jill young ( charlize theron 
 and three trials and countless appeals later 
 and thrills-a-minute 
 and through several genetic tests 
 and throughout the film he slips in and out of a phony boston accent . he is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced . the film places too much weight on broderick's character and not enough on the black soldiers 
" and thus no "" decent "" commercial version will ever be produced . anyway "
 and thus sets sean on a life-long pursuit after the evil castor . normal action movie right ? wrong . flashy action director john woo ( somewhat unsuccessfully ) throws the audience a curveball . to better infiltrate castor's crime syndicate 
 and tim robbins just look back two years ago at the coen brothers' comedic gem the big lebowski 
 and to an extent 
 and to dreamworks credit 
 and to get even 
 and to get the proper tour of her father's homeland 
 and to me 
 and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable . special effects are very important in a film like this : if they're not good 
 and to satisfy tarantino's foot fetish . robert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy- looking 
 and to the story as a whole is the daper 
 and to them 
 and together 
 and together . he's able to verbally explain his motives with well- chosen words . i like dialogue where people come at the subject of discussion from not just one angle 
 and together is a great example of why that happens . to me the model of a great ensemble drama is paul thomas anderson's boogie nights 
 and tom neuwirth's sepia-toned cinematography makes the movie feel as if it were filmed in the 50s . my only quibble is the director's awkward staging of the final scene on the train . is hitchcock's version better ? of course . is this one worth watching as well ? actually 
 and tommy 
 and too gullible . but society has a way of taking these people 
 and too much characterization . i don't really understand it myself 
 and too obsessed with looking all cutting edge to ever be totally smart . that film dealt with a civil war inside a nuclear submarine over whether or not to follow rules or question them 
 and too pathetic to be the classic villain . however 
 and totally heartbreaking for lee 
 and towers above many other movies of its type . the brilliant acting 
 and toy story 2 delivers it with matchless creativity and invention . it'll make you wonder whether all those toys you loved as a kid miss you as much as you miss them . 
 and tragedy together into a complete package . the characters 
 and training himself . but when he sends his application for the school in 
 and trains up thief alejandro murrieta ( banderas ) to become the new zorro . banderas motive ? to avenge the death of his brother 
" and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh ( or supposedly so ) . his speech mannerisms are so "" cute-ified "" that i couldn't understand a third of what he was saying "
 and travis gradually gets alienated from the rest of world . the only bright spot in his life is betsy ( cybil sheperd ) 
 and treats himself with a litany of body-care products . indeed 
 and tried his damnedest to play it straight 
 and tries his best to escape his simian captors . oh yeah 
 and tries to be a philosophical film with moments of humour . even that might have worked had the movie hit the right philosophical note . but it errs there . craig briefly discusses the significance of having access to another person's brain and the responsibility of having such access . maxine ponders the issue of being loved by two people and yet attracted to neither alone and one only when within malkovich . issues of gender identity are briefly touched upon . but the most interesting issue that could have been raised 
 and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things . what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid 
 and tries to make sweet love to a goat in heat . again : stupid ? yes . but the bizarre situations dreamed up by screenwriters schneider and tom brady work 
 and tries to teach the world his message . christ = is also confronted by internal demons and self-doubt 
 and truly only distracting when contrasted with the rest of the film . the novel les misirables is 
 and trust me--the experience is more than worth it . ( this review is copyright 1995 by christopher e . meadows . distribution is okay as long as it's not for profit and this notice remains intact . distribution on cd-rom is verboten without chris's permission

 and two fleas 
 and two smoking barrels has been described as the british pulp fiction 
 and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . they even come up with an inspired riff on something that's baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome 
 and two sweet kids . it's all cute and wonderful

 and who finds passion and meaning among people who live in a different world . annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) lives with her lawyer husband robert ( sam neill ) and their 14-year-old daughter grace ( scarlett johansson ) . on one snowy day in their upstate new york country home 
 and who has saved him from his death . jesus goes = on to live a life as a man 
 and who hasn't done a similar action 
 and who hasnt 
 and who meets a wonderfully ironic ending 
 and who railed and preached against him - flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt - and his driven 
 and whose characterizations have never been better . and while the film's narrative doesn't really warrant a running time of 155 minutes 
 and whose discoveries and simple logical interpretations helped small-time lawyers win one of the biggest lawsuits in american history . her name 
 and why . nonetheless 
 and why it did so in that manner . these technical details serve as a guide for later on when the action starts happening 
 and why it would only hit her a good ways into the affair to at least let him know about it . does she love her husband ? people don't usually get married otherwise 
 and why this is such a good film . the story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14-year old girl named dolores a . k . a . lolita is great because it's not trash for the perverted but because it's about human obsession with things that are out of one's reach . its protagonist 
 and why we're all here . 
 and will accept no substitute . the three of them 
 and will be used as spare parts for reanimation purposes . sure enough 
 and will not move . her sons run away 
 and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life . part of it is his fault - he's too optimistic 
" and william and anna ultimately only have one thing in common : they're lonely . ( worth noting in roberts' and grant's favour : the ubiquitous "" i'm just a girl "
 and william devane oozing smarmy sincerity as the triumvirate who rule the outfit . although a slickly produced crime thriller 
 and william h . macy is great aswell ( but he always is . ) another flaw with the film 
 and winding up in frank's vehicle . and her former drug dealer is given some attention 
 and winds up shooting the store clerk 
 and wit . it proved that it didn't need to brag about it's cutting edge technology to really soar ( it's the least visually striking of the three computer animated films thus far 
 and with a face not so soft as in the photographs of wilde . fry 
 and with another avenger of justice 
 and with bird 
 and with discussing the merits of huey lewis 
 and with much critical praise heaped upon it 
 and with that 
 and with the exception of patrick bernhard 
 and with the exception of sidney poitier 
 and with their eye on a possible financial reward from the empress 
 and with this in mind 
 and with what object . while not as witty as neil simon's murder by death 
 and without a central hero in bergman 
 and without it 
 and won the best actor honor in 1982's academy awards presentation for the title role he portrayed in ghandi . many scenes from this film were actually shot in montreal 
 and won't chase cars . while listening to the radio on christmas eve 
 and wonder why true love doesn't exist for people like him . in the process of performing at these receptions 
 and word of mouth 
 and work together to get themselves out of trouble . there's also a good supporting role by michael rooker ( remember him from henry : portrait of a serial killer ? ) as a cop who tries to put everything together from the outside 
 and works both as a ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression 
 and works just great when you see it for yourself . another batman triumph for burton and keaton 
 and would have made a better 
 and would have made the difference between me getting up the nerve to see it again some day and realizing that this is something i doubt i could endure again . masterful work marred only by excessive gore . 
 and wouldn't you know that history has repeated itself . this time 
 and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh . of course 
 and write a little more about the film 
 and write tough 
 and written by hayao miyazaki 1988 ( 1993 
 and xander berkeley with the release of gattaca 
 and yancy butler doesn't have much to do here--but 
 and yes 
 and yet 
 and yet another wonderfully stolid bad-guy role courtesy of jurgen prochnow . the replacement killers is all surface 
 and yet breaking the rules and modern-day taboos of 90s culture . the style in which it is filmed is rich in color . the actors are all gorgeous people 
 and yet his most = impossibly abstract as well . scorsese presents the life of jesus = christ 
 and yet is both at the same time . the result is a clever comedy based on an original 
 and yet this particular subplot simply peters out . indeed 
 and yet we rarely see anything of the sort on the big screen ( it's mostly implied 
 and yet we so often see him deep in thought . i wondered if he was thinking about things that he would never say ( or didn't know how to say ) or if he was just taking a long time to think about the thing he just said . here he really proves his worth as one of the best character actors in the industry . though the plot is somewhat unoriginal 
 and yong kang - kozmo flamed out in three short years 
 and you can brag that you were one of the elite who stayed and got the full money's worth of entertainment . still 
 and you can find out why and how when you watch for yourself . michael keaton now seems even more comfortable in the wayne/batman role 
 and you can see that here . it's doubtful he'll get another oscar nomination 
 and you can't really tell which side one person is on . the real treat 
 and you could really believe the pain that she was going through . gena rowlands does an outstanding job as her mother 
 and you get the idea . while the film begins unpromisingly 
 and you have no doubt believing that the mountain vistas would put these new yorkers under a spell 
 and you have to pay to see it . it does win you over 
 and you haven't seen this film 
 and you know 
 and you know its ok to laugh at them because they're fictional . director stephen frears 
 and you know you can expect some awkward situations to arise . and perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begins to drop . of course 
 and you might be wondering why i haven't given this film four stars . well 
 and you really believed how her character was feeling . home fries was also suspenseful in it's own way . i wanted certain things to happen and i couldn't tell if they were going to or not . there were a lot of laughs in home fries 
" and you see just how truly remarkable "" chicken run "" really is . this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . as in such top-notch family fare as "" a bug's life "" or "" toy story 2 "
 and you should appreciate their performances . biggs is more than enjoyable 
" and you'll appreciate the futility of comparing greatness in films . the scene in "" the sweet hereafter "" epitomizes all that's right with independent canadian director atom egoyan's film . it's not sensational . we don't see the inside of the bus with its payload of screaming "
 and you'll be kicking yourself if you don't strap in to this one while it's in theaters - some of the images just won't translate as well onto a tv screen . if you haven't seen the film yet 
 and you'll be lunching at the savoy again 
" and you'll get a good sense of what you can expect from "" the butcher boy . "" imagine that and more . neil jordan's latest film "" stars "" rea in more ways than one . rea "
 and you'll sort of understand . anchoring the whole film is the astonishing debut performance of owens ; love francie or hate him 
 and you're in the mood for a weird 
 and you've got a good old fashioned escapist drama which does all the thinking for you so that you never have to actually question the debate over personal privacy and so you can follow will smith's plight without a minute's worth of boredom . 
 and you've got high fidelity ( or maybe the other way around since nick hornby's novel high fidelity came first ) . either way 
 and you've got yourself a decent time at the movie theatre . on the down side 
 and yours truly 
 and--oh yes--love . like 3 men and a baby 
 and--well

" as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis . "" gods and monsters "" is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast "
 as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing . unfortunately 
 as he comes to learn about love 
 as he concentrates all his energy on the young couple 
 as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick 
 as he does in most of his movies . rob schneider 
" as he finds his client less and less sympathetic . zero effect is weakest in its obviously "" wacky "" scenes depicting daryl zero's odd behavior . such scenes might be appropriate in an out-and-out satire "

 as he is convinced that they must travel there . once inside the fortress of ultimate darkness 
 as he is in every scene . by nature of this arrangement 
 as he is known to his friends 
 as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle a variety of situations . girls are going to swoon over him . winslet also proves herself a good actress 
 as he lay himself down to sleep on christmas eve 
 as he makes murphy into a politically savvy but nonetheless clueless assistant who is forced to watch his own career teeter at the brink of being flushed down the toilet . his constant half-truth-telling and spin-doctoring to cover bulworth's stampede is equaled in its perversion only by a self-righteous reporter ( nora dunn ) who acts like murphy's refusal to explain bulworth's actions ( something he really cannot do ) is somehow an act of treason . when bulworth decides he wants to live after all 
 as he offers a hilarious dissenting voice to the proceedings . as i mentioned before 
 as he pretends to be his roommate to keep the kid . the reason i say it's not really sandler's best work is because it gets really sappy towards the end of a movie 
 as he puts it . materialistic culture is still alive and well and 
 as he runs from authorties for reasons that he knows not . the supports are also in fine form 
" as he slips effortlessly into urban slang : "" that be whack ! "" zellweger is also enjoyable "
 as he still had scenes to be completed . rather than recast the role ( and end up reshooting a great deal of footage ) 
 as he totally becomes this heavy metal geek/god ( incidentally 
 as he tries to = find his true purpose throughout the entire film . during the story 
 as he was a man who invented his own public persona

 as himself to be killed off in the first scene . so 
 as his daughter recently died . he is the guardian of his nephew because his brother shot a member of the caravacas family 
" as his murderous purpose becomes clear . "" . . . kill them mercifully "

 as i remember the third film being chock-full of . this is stuff that could actually still seem funny years from now . koteas makes a memorable role himself here

 as if he's thinking about his plan with kate 
 as if it has no boundaries . think of the film city of angels . now add a more complex screenplay and a more unique vision . both films deal with the afterlife 
 as if the most crucial scene was deleted in order to obtain a more lucrative rating . however 
 as if the scriptwriters were desperate for something to spin things in a new direction . also 
 as if they are just reading the words for the first time . it is an irritation and distracts us from what is otherwise a very good thriller . it is one i rate an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high + 2 on the -4 to + 4 scale . 
 as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual . narratively

" as is clancy brown as a kind prison guard ( the complete opposite of his character in "" shawshank redemption "" ) . there is a great amount of talent in this supporting cast but it just never appears . hedaya was superb in "" clueless "
 as is his performance : - he steals every scene he is in even though he does not enter the film until thirty minutes past . joan sims provides useful and amusing support as belle 
 as is the case here . bruce willis's comic talents lie mainly in his deadpan delivery of lines 
 as is the case with most chan films 
 as is the film itself . one highly original element of the film is that judith occasionally imagines things occuring in her mind in the way she wishes they would happen . sometimes it results in comedy

 as it serves almost like a vehicle for the two . as a side note 
 as it set the perfect mood for the film . it's hard to describe in words

 brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character : you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world . in a way

 brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice 
 brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene . i don't want to give them away

 but a bug's life is so good that i'm sure it will find its audience . after a slew of endlessly violent and cynical movies

 but a cheaper model . like dicaprio and winslet 
 but a completely immoral punishment such as this comes to pass . upon his release on parole 
 but a fairly fun and funny b-movie . wipe the dust off this box at your local video store and check it out .

 but a longer-than-necessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor . ) he creates fascinating 
 but a lot happens to the characters emotionally . the film takes place during a few weeks of august at the normandy coast 
 but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up . voiced by eddie murphy 
 but a part nevertheless ) . that seems to be the basic theory behind `go 
 but a personification of all that the nazis stood for . there is no such figure in amistad . the villain is slavery 
 but a real extra-terrestrial alien . when the alien makes a run for it 
 but a religion of sorts to we 
 but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies . the character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology 
 but a smaller one : sometimes it's not possible to use the law as a way to repair what has gone wrong 
 but a strong one that could rival any performance in 1998 . travolta proves that a normal and believable performance can vault a film into oscar nominations . his performance is not flashy 
 but a variation of him . he's sonny coufax 
 but a very real account of class struggle as well . as i mentioned before 
 but a wealthy aunt agreed to take care of her until she married a nice rich man . naturally 
 but about love 
 but about those who want to be celebrities 
 but above all 
 but abruptly dropped and never brought up again . if the film was not going to follow up on this side story 
 but absolutely not a masterpiece . it's among hundreds and thousands good films released every year 
 but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members . it's to note that this film was based on a real-life tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer ( their original singer also admitted to being gay 
" but admits that "" in ten years time "
 but admittedly behaves like a child 
 but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times . frankenheimer masters the script with poise 
 but after a freak accident 
 but after a while it gets boring . it could have easily been cute to about 95 or 105 minutes 
 but after death 
 but after seeing the improvements that had been made 
 but after snipping a few scenes from the finished product 
 but again my memory flickers . what i do remember is that the movie takes place in 1975 stockholm at a large house full of free-loving communists -- kind of like the real world 
 but ain't it fun to watch ? when movies like this come along ( sort of a better version of basic instinct ) there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it . there will be people who don't want to admit liking what they see 
 but all in all 
 but all the rest sucked 
 but all the willpower she has can't help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the south's ultimate defeat . this brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love- hate relationship . most of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship ( or lack thereof ) between rhett and scarlett . each uses the other for personal gain 
 but almost too long ) 
 but also a bit disjointed . many times it's unclear as to exactly what's going on . . . all the audience can tell is that blood is being spilled . we're not sure who's blood or by who's hand though . there's an instance of this earlier in the film too that's disappointing . it's comes when maximus escapes his executioners . some flashes and a few quick cuts later and maximus is free . . . but i still don't know exactly how he did it . russell crowe should have become a major star after his gleefully over the top role as a computer generated serial killer in 1995's virtuosity . for whatever reason his stardom never arrived . . . but he should have it now . from here on moviegoers should now be able to say 
 but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks . rockwell 
 but also demonstrates to us how smart women master the most impossible situations . though maybe not quite so impossible as this film . 
" but also face the greatest power on earth - death . cameron could as well have called his picture "" the never ending love "" or "" love at first sight "" "
 but also from hector elizondo as the hotel manager 
 but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top . actually 
 but also in countless tributes and references that movie makers use in their works to this day . casablanca is also a movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critics and loved by general audience . one of the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed to fail 
 but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burton's mars attacks ! and larry cohen's original gangstas ( where she first teamed up with mr . forster . ) of course 
 but also irene 
 but also manages enough intelligence to force you to suspend your disbelief . to top it all off 
 but also manages to provide a well-balanced plot . beginning with the first man on mars ( something i have always dreamed of seeing ) 
 but also manages to teach every major player a lesson 
 but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery . the film periodically jumps between shaw's point of view and the perspective of the black soldiers . the movie introduces us to a handful of black recruits 
 but also pretty decent . to be honest 
 but also reminds us of the intense physical experience of playing . for true sportsmen 
 but also rescue this once-profitable series from the scrap heap . despite the odds 
 but also risks his movie with a few bold steps . in the end 
 but also some borderline fun-making of the disabled and mentally-challenged . i must admit that i really wasn't sure whether to laugh at some points or not . not a good place to be . having said that 
" but also the best mindfuck of the entire year . not that i want every kafkaesque film to be "" the game "" ( this year's "" the spanish prisoner "" succeeds with less thrills and chills ) "
 but also the real jerome 
 but also the various tolls it can take on the major players . a civil action provides everything a drama lover craves . 
 but also to the innumerable little stories that are out there 
 but also to treat them with considerable respect . alvin straight ( richard farnsworth ) is 73 years old 
 but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out 
 but also won't mind talking about the next day at the water cooler . the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles 
 but also works because of this 
 but alvin is not swayed : he trades it in and uses the last of his money to buy a 1966 john deere mower 
 but americans and brits posing as italians and greeks can be too much to bear at times . cage seems to channeling a toned-down roberto benigni 
 but an ideology 
 but anderson seems terminally unable to provide satisfactory conclusions to his otherwise well structured recent narratives . ( let's pretend the loathsome and predictable next stop wonderland never happened 
 but apparently there is no way to stop it . the world has had this information for months 
 but are at different stages of their lives and have different occupations . nadia ( gina mckee ) is an attractive but lonely waitress 
 but aren't telling . the hard part about seeing a classic now is the pop culture monster has usually drawn and quartered and then flaunted all the memorable moments 
 but as an exercise in pure entertainment 
 but as dialogue 
" but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border . it would not be a stretch to say that "" men with guns "" is a depressing film . in fact "
 but as far as i can tell oliver stone's script contains the said expletitive more times than any other film in cinema history . yet it would be a shame if bad language is all de palma's scarface is remembered for 
 but as he gets to know sam more personally 
 but as it recurs 
 but as john spends more time with her 
 but as played by mckellar 
 but as sharply-drawn 
 but as small accidents start to befall dora - usually while bruno is away on business - she starts to suspect that marco ( played with uncanny ability by 8 year old david colin jr . ) is somehow involved in the strange goings on . to reveal any more of the story would be unfair . suffice to say that this artfully paced study of a woman suffering a nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot 
 but as the camera pulls back 
 but as the film grew into a major flashback ( most of the film is presented as such ) 
 but as the saga of an extraordinary individual whose feasibility for success doesn't automatically signify he must make easy 
 but as the year 2000 approaches 
" but as with most of "" chicken run "
 but at 82 minutes it's tight and fresh . i understand that director hiroyuki tanaka is something of a great white hope for japanese film right now 
 but at a minimum 
 but at a price . langella takes a totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original . quilty was a comic character in the original : a threat in the form of many forms 
 but at least it's less cryptic than ellis' novel . for once 
 but at least this time he has something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo alicia silverstone . . . fraser is the lead star of the mummy 
" but at that moment he gets a phone call and has to go "" show his face "" at the house of a just-deceased patient . this turns out to be the beginning of a long and eventful night on the town . the daughter of the dead patient hits on him but he wisely turns her down . he almost does the dirty deed with a kindly hooker who approaches him on the street . then "
 but at the same time batters patiently at the man's defenses 
 but at the same time seems just a bit hollow . another couple is jerry ( stiller ) and terri ( keener ) who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time 
 but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality . the basic story is rather sorted 
 but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other . scarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett can't help but want her more every time she tries to one-up him such as marrying another man and taking over his business . they say opposites attract 
 but at times i didn't know quite how to take it . but this is a relatively small complaint about a very good movie . a good movie allows its characters to learn and grow . it doesn't just happen ; it takes a good script 
 but at times schroeder doesn't fill in the blanks . the movie could have benefited with the increased attention of certain developments during the film 
 but at times the forced conflict is so embarrasingly mindless it made me cringe . at first sight is based on a story by oliver sacks about restored sight . in the film 
 but banderas does some excellent work . as the bad guys 
 but barely 
 but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence 
 but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways . i like his quick-edit style 
 but beatty does it so well it's irrelevant . in fact 
 but because 
" but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that . "" do we have ammunition factories ? do we have food ? do we have a navy ? all we have is tobacco . "" all true statements and yet the south still insists he's wrong . butler is a shifty character to be sure "
 but because it has lofty aspirations and succeeds in them . not just any film can poke fun at shakespeare and get away with it . 
 but because it pays attention to detail and knows its subject matter . i was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role : he has such searing optimism and energy ; he's clearly a man who admires shakespeare 
 but because it put front-and-center black issues that had never been dealt with before . until that point 
" but because it's a film that flat-out says you can make a career out of gambling . and to take make things "" worse "" it proves this through its original "
 but because it's a fun 
 but because of a powerful 
 but because of his condition 
 but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago 
 but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original . one of such masterpieces is casablanca 
 but before you know it the bad guys show up and retrieve the strange man . enter fallon ( played by denis leary ) 
 but behind that sparkling curtain of incredible visuals - is emptiness - nothing to think about . the main weakness of this film 
 but being simms becomes the part of jack's life . he thrives in it 
" but beyond that there are some oddities . the evil army is called "" holnists "" which sounds coincidentally like the new age "" holism "" "
 but bombs are generally not designed to do much else 
 but both are stubborn and willful 
 but both share a passion for out-thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them . where as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating ( hence his jail time ) 
 but both were wrong . sandy tries to rekindle their relationship 
 but bowfinger still has the intent to shoot the film . after emptying out his life savings 
 but branaugh brings real humanity to his character . without it 
 but brings up the valid criticism that rohmer's characters occasionally become didactic . rohmer's imperfect but assured push toward the future remains staunch and notable for casting a cautious eye upon the past while taking bold steps forward into an uncertain future . what may arouse interest in the lady and the duke outside of foreign film enthusiasts with literary and historical passions is rohmer's use of cutting edge digital technology as a means of exploring the theme of artifice as safety net or coping mechanism . the actors were filmed against a bluescreen 
 but by doing so causes other changes . somehow 
 but by his own innate behaviour . whether he's flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi 
 but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped . he wants the dude to act as go-between for the kidnapers . dude and his friend walter ( john goodman ) take on the task 
 but can't go to the police in 1969 because they'd never believe his story . so he hides the wallet beneath a loose floorboard 
 but can't scrounge up enough sparks to keep the momentum flowing . this film has a great opening 
 but casablanca is still a shining example of hollywood ww2 movie that is beliavable 
 but certainly hostile 
 but certainly offenbach . -----------== posted via deja news 
 but certainly powerless . his alter ego is forceful and totally without conscience . two parts that make up a whole . neither are capable of functioning without the other and once separated 
 but change it to fit the film's needs . species ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft 
 but charming foreign films in which not much happens plot wise 
 but coming together when it counts . antonio banderas and carla gugino are even better as the parents ; they quickly establish and maintain a great lusty chemistry while keeping their tongues properly in cheek during the action scenes . even the usually irritating alan cumming has some nice moments  a virtual cloud-backed chat between his character and juni is one of the best segments in the film . had rodriguez added a few more scenes like that 
 but compared to the average person 
 but comparing those scenes with typical scenes today i simply can't avoid to appreciate the difference from today's movie fights when masses of bloody pulp manage to get up from the floor and win in the end . so 
 but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father 
 but continually haunted by his past . the supporting cast is also extraordinary . the only actor who dims in comparison is hans matheson 
 but d . a . pennebaker ( the war room 
 but damnit 
 but danny's too cool a cat to fall for her wholesome appeal in front of his t-bird buddies ( including jeff conaway ) . so sandy hooks up with a gang herself -- the pink ladies 
 but dark city is much more thoughtful and much less violent . not clever or complex 
 but dark city is worth watching 
 but debut director and screenwriter mark christopher keeps things moving with lively snapshots of the studio 54 hustle and bustle and an even livelier cast to inhabit his bouncy vision . the film boasts some fine comic creativity 
 but decides to spend a week in his company learning more about the human condition . parrish is the only one aware of pitt's true identity 
 but definitely the most popular one . its popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half a century since its premiere 
 but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) 
 but did the next best thing : he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general . in that film 
 but didn't appreciate the film's lack of human character development ( why was kris kristofferson even in this movie ? ) and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring . but i would still recommend this film as a fun 
 but didn't offer anything extraordinary 
 but didn't really start laughing at it until after the gremlins popped out all over . the puppetry and radio-controlled gremlins in this movie were both extremely well-done . the gremlins have a little more personality in this film than in the first one . gremlins 2 took a good idea and made it better . i hope dante & company quit while they are ahead . i'm not sure how the movie is doing . we saw it in an empty theater today 
 but dignified man 
 but directed and written in such a way that the film feels as light as a feather 
 but director mary harron reaches the right balance 
 but disapproving maid ( touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave ) 
 but discovers that most of them have retired as well . gone in sixty seconds does things right from the opening credits . in that sequence 
 but discovers that she 
 but ditzy hooker 
 but do it . you are what you are . . for do not doubt 
 but do it in a slow pace . the only major flaw in the film besides the performance by daniels is length . some films are not meant to be that long . pleasantville is one of those films . this film could have been so much better had they not moved so slowly to it . first 
 but does give us more than your typical movie of this type . for example 
 but does not pretend to be 100% factual . plot : naval officer ramirez ( quinn ) gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal 
 but does so by pushing it to the extreme 
 but doesn't fit into this comedy mold as well as the director may have hoped . the supporting cast sparkles . joe viterelli is hilarious as jelly 
 but doesn't give her much emotional self-defense . acting a catalyst to the love triangle 
 but doesn't have a lot of ambition - he just follows everyone else . mary is a writer of some sort 
 but doesn't have a stomach/lack of brains to do it . while de niro's travis might come in and out of particular times and places 
 but doesn't have the down ending of other works of this kind . the production design of this film is probably the best i've seen this year : it's stunning 
 but don't actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him . there are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest 
 but don't create enough believable sparks together to make their relationship click properly . pierce brosnan perhaps wasn't the best actor to take over for steve mcqueen 
 but don't expect miracles either . films about love and war should have pathos and grit 
" but don't expect to leave in an upbeat mood . [this appeared in the 2/25 "" bloomington voice "" "
 but done in a way that is not heavy-handed at all 
 but driving the boat in the water is not . the two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended . flash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant ( sam neill ) in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide . he has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs . but again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go . doing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple ( william h . macy and tea leoni ) who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs . they too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn . he will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once . right . guess what happens next ? jp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2 . first it has alan grant and ellie sattler ( laura dern ) back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm . sattler has a much smaller part in jp3 
 but duguay always seemed to find something interesting to show the viewer . i thought that was neat . having said that 
 but each supporting character is a refreshing comic figure . all the characters end up as the butt of jokes 
 but easy job . this isn't so for watson 
 but effective performance . samuel l . jackson is very good 
 but elliot gave her the necessary bubbly personality that made her irresistible . i will probably file away the wings of the dove in the same low-traffic corner of my mind as sense and sensibility and persuasion . their settings are far removed from my personal experience - geographically 
 but enough about that . the prime concern for this prequel is introducing young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) into the picture . as you already know 
 but enough to make us believe his character . actually 
 but equally hilarious 
" but erin makes her services hard to refuse : "" i need a job . don't make me beg . if it doesn't work out "
 but even at its most dense 
 but even here clint manages to keep the movie fascinating . certainly the characterizations of the judge and spacey's lawyer both help immensely 
 but even if we can't 
 but even if your under 17 or above at least 13 this film is good enough for you to see . don't try to be one of those people who make so much of a film that they do not like it 
 but even that collapses when he realizes he's left his face mask at hime -- and the only mask he can find at the corner convenience store ( in a hilarious piece of montage ) is a children's-sized job . in despair 
 but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots . the suspense tapers off considerably by the end 
 but eventually he returns to life under the streets . all of this primarily occurs off-screen 
 but everyone hates them 
" but explaining them risks ruining their effect . there are more players this time around as to provide both a higher number suspects and a staggering body count . it's something of a trade-in -- the new characters are too large in number to be as fully-developed as the original "" scream "" gang "
 but expose him to a single 30-year-old beauty and he's a mess . much to gavin's surprise 
 but fails 
 but fails because the advantages of virtual reality in comparison to the real world are never shown . existenz is not a world of which you might dream about in your fantasies . it is not a world worth sacrificing your life for . it's a cold 
 but fails miserably . he then has dinner with his brother jeff ( rob morrow ) 
 but fails miserably to pull through 
 but fails to grasp that special something that makes such films more than layers of mist . 
 but falls short of actualizing its potential . though not for lack of trying . in many respects 
 but feels like 300 minutes 
 but finds himself unable to call off the hit . bulworth also finds romance with the fiery 
 but finds his stride in the latter half . it is good to see the actor return to roles with a bit of an edge to them 
 but first time feature director alan cohn keeps proceedings light and upbeat . there are plenty of funny moments throughout 
 but flawed 
 but focused on the actual characters 
 but for all of hanks' glorious work in serious films 
 but for all the rest of you out there 
 but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well . i especially enjoyed bonham carter's performance 
 but for much of the middle third of the film 
 but for near- geniuses with nerves of steel . the game is a quiet war 
 but for now they're more interested in their environs than they are in each other . no single element really makes this movie outstanding - not even the sense of paranoia that makes the tv show so popular . but enough things were done right that the x-files is one of the more interesting summer adventures to come along . check out more current movie reviews at http : //www . indra . com/~mmapes/ 
 but for once i didn't want to slap the taste out of his mouth . he plays his role in out of sight as the suave cary grant-type perfected in hitchcock movies 
 but for some reason or another things just don't always work out . it's comical 
 but for some unexplained reason was given this related title for release in the usa and australia . ) this story focuses on dora 
 but for storytelling itself . the film takes place in georgia before 
 but for the most part 
 but for the most part he adds some neccesary comic relief . the greatest part of this film is amazingly not the visuals 
 but for the most part i felt lynch handled such scenes judiciously . they go on long enough to achieve their intended effect 
 but for the scenes she does have 
 but for the security they bring . the furnace in the basement is a scary monster 
 but for those who are into exploitative thrillers like basic instinct or sliver 
 but fortunately 
 but fortunately there's enough evidence here to support she will be more accurate in the future . 
 but from the strength of flynt and althea's love for each other . woody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly a career-topping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt . harrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness to make him endearing and entirely sympathetic to the audience 
 but from what i've heard 
" but gazing at it in wonderment . so music is an important tone-setter in "" wonderland "" -- but it's always kept for these side-moments "
 but generally the editing could of been a bit tighter . the plot also side-tracks into a silly cocaine dealing bust 
 but generally this the bible story we all know and love 
 but generates enough twists and turns to keep most people interested throughout . mind you 
 but gets less screen time . both children manage the same trick 
 but gets lost in a blur of drugs 
 but getting her emotions all wrong . one minute she hates quaid 
 but given the fact that there were several new characters to cover 
 but gleeson has been in over a dozen movies 
 but had a terrific time at gremlins 2 today . yes 
 but hang in there 
 but has a great role as a thug who takes his part as the apothecary so seriously . ben affleck 
" but has advantages over each of them in one way or another . it's more fast-paced and accessible than "" silkwood "" "
 but has also a plot worth making movies about . based on anne rice's novel 
 but has fun coming up with bizarre tangents to the story ( like when griswold tries to transform into kabukiman and . . . uh . . . comes up with something else ) 
 but has it always been that way ? how did it _get_ that way ? also 
 but has plans 
 but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign 
 but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years : mary 
" but he also developed a little marketing scheme : he coined the phrases "" rated x by an all-white jury "
 but he can move the camera like malick and capture action scenes like peckinpah . foxx is always a surprise to watch as an actor 
 but he can't contact her directly 
 but he can't tell the difference between a real apple and a picture of an apple . virgil is aided by visual therapist phil webster ( nathan lane ) . lane's performance is very good 
 but he covers familiar territory quite well . yesterday 
 but he didn't start out asking for 
 but he does assume the role surprisingly well . he'd almost be on the same level as connery if not for the fact that he reminds me so much of adam west 
 but he does provide enough quiet moments for viewers to become fully invested in the family . alexa vega and daryl sabara make an agreeable brother and sister team 
 but he doesn't really want to do much of anything besides go bowling 
 but he doesn't take himself too seriously . he has friendly 
 but he eventually grows into his own under elijah's tutelage . jackson is one of the better actors of our time 
" but he gets stuck saying things like "" once you learn how to die "
 but he goes has some good lines 
 but he is - poor . on the other hand we have cal . he is a bastard that treats rose as an odalisque and not as his wife-to-be . he lacks everything jack possesses 
 but he is -- rich . this childish contrast between the social classes is one of those things that makes titanic nothing more than a mediocre picture . cameron knows precisely what we want to see . his film therefore contains certain minimums to draw an audience - attractive actors 
 but he is also having an affair with a chinese immigrant who works in a whore house . arthur's 11-year-old son 
 but he is criminally underused with his undemanding role . maury chaykin hams it up as a budha-like art dealer . will patton has little to do playing zeta-jones' boss . amiel also uses a fade-out approach to end many of his scenes 
 but he is not a child . he has thought about his life and made rational decisions about what he wants . sean 
 but he is nothing like you at all . he uncontrollably cheats and lies 
 but he is only human and she has the greatest smile . plus 
 but he is powerless in his passion . when sir mordred ( patrick bernhard ) accuses lancelot of the affair 
 but he is presented as a character with real emotions 
 but he is still a good actor . he and barrymore are dating in real life 
 but he is still regarded as a secondary actor . in a civil action 
 but he is surrounded by a great supporting cast . on a planet way the hell out there 
 but he isn't annoying 
 but he isn't given much to work with here . platt 
 but he keeps getting distracted by family troubles . stuart's relatives are a mess : his dad and brother ( harris yulin and vincent d'onofrio 
 but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor . as i say 
 but he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature . there's no doubt about it : the film that johnson has crafted is rich . he chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown 
 but he makes the most of it . you must have admiration 
 but he mysteriously ends up dead . they try again through brown 
 but he never expected this 
" but he plays it perfectly . the more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that he's one of the treasures of our time . it's odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barr's television husband . more like the coen's "" raising arizona "" than their hit "" fargo "" "
 but he portrays the main antagonist suitably enough . soldier strikes me as a made-for-the-scifi-channel movie with a budget . despite the talent behind the film 
" but he says it's beyond fixing . "" but i just got the humanitarian award ! "" he fires back "
 but he seems to be enjoying himself in a rare comic role that enables him to put a different spin on the type of character that he has made his own . in a welcome return to form 
" but he should have listened to dennis hopper's advice in tarantino's true romance : "" slooooooow it down "
 but he smells a great deal is being held away from a lot of people's noses here 
 but he sticks by simon ; the two tough it out through the worst of times and are each other's only true friends . early on 
" but he sure tells a good story ! "" neurotic ruby thinks she may have found true love after a series of nightmarish dating disasters ( the junkie "
 but he takes such pride in his arrogance it's appealing . scarlett notices this too when she first sees him 
" but he turns in a great performance anyway . ben kingsley ( "" species "" "
 but he usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience . he handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones ( he tends to pile on to much schmaltz ) but generally he's good . there's also a nice soundtrack by veteran composer hans zimmer . but 
 but he's also a troublemaker . the ants spend all season putting together the offering 
 but he's also very smart . the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men . it's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs 
 but he's certainly not distracting . max von sydow is underused 
 but he's clearly just playing a skewed version of his own public image here . the other artistes give their characters more personality 
 but he's either too apathetic or too defeated to do anything to change . this film has taken a critical drubbing from many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simply throws one trip scene after another at the audience . while gilliam may have overdone it in a few places 
 but he's got a yakuza boss squeezing him for cash 
 but he's having a good time . when asked what he does for fun 
 but he's just too hard to hate . jacqueline bisset proves that she is every bit as stirring as she ever was 
 but he's not always in great films . everything comes together here . gere is a big time chicago defense attorney who takes on a seemingly unwinable case in hopes of even more publicity . it doesn't go exactly as he expects . gere's client 
 but he's not very interesting . there's no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character 
 but he's still great in this 
 but he/she is . . . missing 
 but her cautious therapist ( holland taylor ) warns her that co-dependency is rearing its ugly head again and she's in over her head with yet another doomed relationship . who ya gonna believe ? despite her winning an academy award 
 but her delivered lines seemed very flat 
 but her overdone lip quivering during her crying scenes becomes a distraction ; and matheson 
 but her role was pallid . now finally helen hunt has come into her own . without bravura or pointedly dramatic or humorous scenes and repartees 
 but her scenes with damon number too few to be very effective . john turturro's aging mentor and famke janssen's tempting siren 
 but her trademark unconventional speech rhythms and line delivery make her somewhat hard to buy as a star news broadcaster . although its catastrophic theme and impressive special effects work ( the giant ocean waves are particularly spectacular ) place deep impact in the same category as the likes of twister 
 but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences' sympathy 
 but here we have a movie that defines success : it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written . it could have been a smug 
 but hey 
 but hilary is seen as the better of the two . jackie 
 but his actual faith is left pretty vague . i can't even say for certain that he was supposed to be a christian . all we know is that he dropped out of the seminary and obviously has no qualms about pre-marital sex . the film drops the science ball at the very end 
 but his attention is drawn away by an unexpected obituary notice that triggers memories of his long shrouded past . this sort of thing only happens in the movies 
 but his bizarre behavior 
 but his character is not nearly as involving as the wheelchair-bound ( and appropriately named ) bella ( mckee 
 but his chauffeur 
 but his choice of material is bizarre and gets him beat up . he finally caves in and looks for a job 
 but his commune buddies succeed in breaking him out . from there 
 but his direction is assured and intelligent 
 but his enigma is never as refined as ripley's is . the film even treats him with a slight contempt : there is always something distasteful in harry's brisk arrogant walk 
" but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas . "" bullets over broadway "
 but his hairpiece needs some serious work . leoni is a subtle charmer as the spunky mother of two 
" but his hot head and an increasingly out of control drug addiction prove his undoing . "" never do your own stash "" "
 but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out 
 but his loss is nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler ( melinda dillon ) 
 but his main goal in life is . . . well 
 but his more complicated scenes are those in which he's been inhabited by other people . his adoption of their mannerisms is so committed that we forget he's acting . we just believe it . malkovich is the man onscreen 
 but his motivation came across more sound this time around 
 but his movie also gave the mythology itself a huge boost 
 but his narration is what brings it all together . he never sounds like he's reading from a script 
" but his opinions feel lifted out of the latest "" rolling stone "" . bateman is entirely self-absorbed "
 but his portrayal is appropriate for a film that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the personal . the set design and cinematography are outstanding 
 but his relationship has curdled into an embittered separation . as the weeks draw on 
 but his relationship with his wife ( regina king ) is basically fine regardless . he has a kid 
 but his research becomes a popular phenomenon . soon 
 but hopefully she will get many more roles from this one . expect to see her name floating around the oscar nominations ( and hopefully she will even be able to nab one ) . reviewed by respect ( respect@aros . net ) http : //www . aros . net/~respect/movies . html 
 but how did they come to reach these motives ? there had to be some kind of communication that we didn't learn about . i know 
" but how it can be used in a dramatic context . "" frequency "" is such a film "
 but how it is about it . ' because so many outside factors come into play in the film's plot and significance as part of a trilogy 
 but how many new generations will catch on later ? it will be as in many of the other gags 
" but howitt comes up with clever "" intersections "" between the plots "
 but i admired its audacity . 
 but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film's pacing . earlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well . the two seemed exclusive of one another 
" but i appreciated its inclusion nonetheless . i had great hopes for this reteaming of jim carrey and the farrelly brothers ( they first worked together on "" dumb and dumber "" ) "
 but i can admit to laughing over some of his harmless 
 but i can honestly say that i was never once bored during the viewing of this entire picture . i wouldn't recommend it to those who don't like car chases 
 but i can't imagine that being too hard to accomplish . secondly 
 but i can't recall his reasons . with this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy ( err . . . second trilogy . . . well you know what i mean ) . and in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which 
 but i can't talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone 
 but i couldn't help but be entranced by its simple charm all the same . miyazaki always does that to me . one thing about miyazaki is that he likes to make references to other films . for example 
" but i definitely expected greater coolness from tim burton . the "" surprise ending "" that highlighted the original planet of the apes film back in 1968 "
 but i did laugh more than once . okay 
 but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing : sequels 
 but i didn't necessarily believe that redford would fall for such a cold fish 
 but i do believe the plot point to be a spoiler 
 but i do enjoy home alone almost every year . don't let your impressions of the others detract from the original 
 but i do have to say 
 but i do know that lapaglia's over-the-top performance should not be missed . the scrumptious comic acting 
 but i do strongly recommend it 
 but i don't really know . all i know is that i just like them both . they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that's really hard to resist 
 but i don't want to . it's such a nice surprise 
 but i dont know 
 but i doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office . costing around $85 million to make 
 but i felt it would have worked better if this route was taken in a more leisurely fashion . it also felt like there was a distinctive lack of insight into the inner workings of these characters - the film clearly shows what flynt 
 but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox . the film was reportedly shot in eleven days 
 but i found it a little hard to accept that all of them would so quickly resort to murder . and although they at least didnt have anyone get hacked to death with a knife 
" but i found myself saying "" that was it ? ! "" when unbreakable revealed its own ending . it's not that the ending is bad "
 but i get the feeling he could have rented old yeller or watched a few self-help infomercials and came out ok . sarcastic comments aside 
 but i had no idea he could act as well . his insistence to be alone 
" but i hope some parents force it upon their children to see this movie . it's a great movie ( and like the back of the video says ) "" that every american should see . "" overall "
 but i just happen to be able to understand them for some mysterious reason . very few dubs have ever done that for me . and now i've reached the point where 
 but i liked the performances from roache and elliot . roache successfully conveyed his character's ambivalence toward millie : near the end 
" but i loved him in the big lebowski . the part of jeff "" the dude "" lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind "
 but i must have laughed for the next five minutes 
 but i never thought bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being . to say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that he's as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger . one sequence in particular 
 but i often find myself compelled to pop in the dvd of either member of the preceding duo 
" but i put it instead on that small shelf of films that abandon all pretense at being entertainment and just give you an experience : "" begotten "" "
 but i soon forgot about the novel and didn't end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore . i picked it up and read it 
 but i still can't believe it . i look at you people and wonder 
 but i still felt kinda bad for her 
 but i strongly disagree . mixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux-pas . i'll probably never see home alone 3 
 but i suppose august and yglesias felt one tragic heroine ( fantine ) was enough . even so 
 but i suspect children will get more laughs out of it than adults . certainly 
 but i suspect that much of it only came from whale's inner fantasies and hallucinations . whale 
 but i suspect the audience will get the idea . 
 but i tell you 
 but i think he is effective . sure 
 but i think it's also a bit of a kick in the pants 
 but i think that it at least gives hawtrey a new part to play instead of the usual dimwit characters . as a matter of fact 
 but i think that the predictability of our own stereotypes was what the screenwriter was knowingly commenting on . i back this up with another scene where the bus stops at a roadside diner in tennessee . the instant we see all the white faces inside 
 but i was incapable of disliking . colonel terry childers ( samuel l . jackson ) is a decorated marine and vietnam veteran . his latest assignment is to fly into yemen with a squad of marines and rescue an ambassador ( ben kingsley ) and his family from protestors at the american embassy . when the protestors turn violent and marines are killed 
 but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al' s toy barn 
 but i will do my best to be vague ( now 
 but i will provide for you the initial setup . jennifer jason leigh makes her big screen return 
 but i wish there was more of his character here . i would've preferred more scenes of human interaction and therapy between virgil and phil than dull lectures from bruce davison's character . but that's only a minor problem . the film's two biggest flaws are the introduction of two minor characters that didn't need to be in this story . steven webber plays sorvino's ex-husband and boss . first of all 
 but i would personally take realism 
 but i wouldn't really mind if he did . the real surprise here is annabella sciorra who impressed last year with cop land . this may be her breakout role and may garner her some much needed attention . it's also quite possible that she could get an oscar nomination . however 
 but i'd actually compare it to that before i'd compare it to happy gilmore . while the wedding singer maintains some of that post-snl cornball humor 
 but i'd like to think that i'm beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time . recently 
" but i'd never believe it . "" great stuff . the downside to spending so much time with william is that we don't get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible . we're constantly exposed to william's thoughts "
 but i'll say it again--these fights don't just _happen_ 
 but i'm not really sure why . it's an exciting 
 but i'm pretty sure andrew niccol 
 but i've always been a fan of his . the one person i was not so impressed by was lili taylor 
 but if his next project is going to continue this trend toward formalism 
 but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest 
 but if there is a problem to be mentioned 
 but if you cross chuckie from child's play with some of the wacky fantasies in heavenly creatures 
 but if you enjoy this type of humor 
 but if you give it a chance it will make you think a little bit . which is a good thing . 
 but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience 
 but if you're looking for a solid warm-up to the summer movie season 
 but if you've got it 
 but important 
 but in both cases the gimmicks work . the object of my affection roughly fits the romantic comedy mold . it has its share of humorous moments and a romantic issue at its heart 
 but in both senses 
 but in creating a likable buffoon in jiff as well . these three talented comic minds have squeezed every morsel of potential out of this premise 
 but in daylight he doesn't look it ! daylight is a great disaster movie . if you've seen cliffhanger 
 but in handing over their arms to the still-fighting germans 
 but in other areas it works to full effect . it's kind of a mixed bag 
 but in personal and selfish motives . still others point to the clich black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex 
 but in the end 
 but in the end he seems to see her as his creation 
 but in the right roles he has great depth . in this movie 
 but in this case 
 but in this case that's no big deal . ) this time 
 but in this comedy from harold ramis ( groundhog day 
 but in this film 
 but in this film she is even better 
 but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film's charm . his finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost -- such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers 
 but instead an honest and convincing portrait of a handful of unhappy people whose lives are going nowhere 
" but instead earns some serious consideration as well . there is a theme running throughout "" me "
 but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit-picking and guilt loading . it's the kind that goes something like 
 but instead he loses it all in a single hand . months later 
 but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating . the focus of this film 
 but instead of fame 
 but instead of visualizing this act of regicide 
 but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout . j . t . walsh 
 but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs . since it's all computer-enhanced anyway 
 but intelligent and hard-to-get julia-louis dreyfuss 
 but interesting relationship that carries this enjoyable comedy on a steady wave of laughs from start to finish . casting robert deniro as paul vitti is something of an in-joke 
 but ironically 
" but is a treat for those viewers who often like to venture outside of the big-budget genre and see a good art film . this is the first film by acclaimed director eric rohmer ( 1969's "" my night at mauds "
 but is at times a muted adaptation that might disappoint the hard core fans of the story but will satisfy most others . i'm somewhere in between and i recommend the picture either way . set in early 19th century france 
 but is bathed in shadows the entire time 
 but is entirely a work of fiction . however it's a work of fiction that's great entertainment 
 but is even more startled by the beauty of the woman in the other boat . annie ( annabella sciorra ) spies chris 
 but is given commands by a higher ranking human . visually 
 but is in the right place at the wrong time . a tunnel connecting new york and new jersey has both sides collapses when a group of robbers collide with a truck carrying * very * flammable toxic waste . a dozen or so people survive the collapses and the incinerating fireball ( and what a fire ball it was ! ) stallone 
 but is is just as complex 
 but is later captured and sold as a slave to proximo ( oliver reed ) . proximo is looking for gladiators to earn himself money ( he being a former gladiator himself ) 
 but is much more amazing than the third installment . the style is the best part of the film 
 but is never heard when you hear of big box office draws like tom hanks 
 but is nevertheless ready to lead 10 
 but is often not taken very seriously by her managers 
 but is rather a more poignant and evocative tale of a tragically doomed and illicit love affair . many writers 
 but is saved from her self-proclaimed fate by jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) 
 but is still an intelligent and vibrantly-acted drama . the film begins as amy ( mira sorvino ) 
 but is still present to tie this story to the first . curiously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance . one thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other 
 but is still the most satisfying ) 
 but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all : to leave the grossly abusive donnie . as donnie 
 but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two . obviously 
" but isn't quite sure how to handle "" sam deed "" when he starts explaining the barcode on his arm "
 but isn't that what his character is like ? the moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done 
 but it 
 but it also adds some restrictions . someone searching for a sweet escape to the theater could do far worse than runaway bride 
 but it also asks questions worthy of films such as brazil or blade runner . dark city is what philosophers would call an existentialist screenplay . a little more than 200 years ago 
" but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion . there are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that ( s ) he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction . as for the question of whether or not "" scream 2 "" is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor . . . well "
" but it also serves as the debut for director antoine fuqua ( whose only previous directorial job was the "" gangster's paradise "" video for coolio ) . both director and actor have veteran confidence in this movie "
" but it also takes sandler to a higher level than anyone expected . this is one to see again and again . is it possible the wedding singer could be one of the sweetest romantic comedies of 1998 ? my "" magic 8-ball "" predicts it is certain . "
 but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply . but it's entertaining as hell 
 but it certainly delivers what you expect from a comedy : plenty of laughs . 
 but it certainly is smart . most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s 
 but it certainly makes up for it with it's good storyline and it's other appealing characters . this film is genuinely funny and i could watch it again and again and not get bored ! 
 but it could have been even better had it expanded on that theme more specifically . still 
 but it could have been so much more rewarding . 
 but it didn't really blow me away like the others . then again 
 but it does 
 but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment . i'm not sure which is the better movie 
 but it does have a lot to offer : an interesting lifetime 
 but it does have an honesty that is refreshing and consistently enjoyable to watch 
 but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had . some of that is in the casting of the two leads . jeremy irons 
 but it does just what it needs to : stay on the screen as long as it needs to be there ( no longer 
 but it doesn't come up with anything that leaves us tearing out the cushions of our seats in amazement : the movie isn't working in that direction . the timing in every scene is comic 
 but it doesn't really matter 
 but it doesn't start to drag too badly till the end . i'd recommend it to fans of matthew perry and bruce willis . if you dislike these actors 
 but it doesn't take long for both of them to recognize a kindred spirit in the other . a friendship is born 
" but it ends up falling into a patterned plot and perpetuating other forms of sexism . what is the role of a woman in the ruthlessly competitive and testorone-tilted world of wall street ? she could be a secretary and get called "" sweetie "
 but it eventually recouped itself with a climax that has to be seen to be believed . the dialogue is edgy and inventive 
 but it fails to give us enough of either one . as i mentioned earlier 
 but it features a performance that any de niro fan should seek out . 
 but it feels mechanic and obligatory rather than racy as it was intended . neve campbell 
 but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face . 
 but it gets a lot of mileage regardless . jackie saves a motorcross driver from snakebite ( driving the atv over the finish line himself ) ; gets mixed up with a journalist who wants to write about his story ; wrecks a mitsubishi sports car ; winds up in the netherlands 
 but it goes something like this . larry and tom are cousins 
 but it goes to prove that no one can make a film like him 
 but it got rather silly when i lost track of the number of times it occurred . helping to foster the sinister atmosphere is a fine performance by pfeiffer 
 but it has a certain charm . the supporting cast is made up of largely familiar faces 
 but it has the best excuse of all : it's funny . it may not go down as an all-time classic 
 but it hits all the right notes . however 
 but it is a little thin 
 but it is a poorly-lit 
 but it is a very intriguing ingredient in the film . and then there's billy bob thorton 
 but it is able to maintain a sense of direction under the cool hand of director antoine fuqua . known mainly for music videos and the replacement killers 
 but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief . as the film flashes back to 1935 
 but it is also much stronger than 
 but it is also the first film that david cronenberg has made since 1996's erotic car crash thriller ( ? ) crash . the canadian filmmaker is known for his unique visual sense 
 but it is also tiering and too melancholic 
 but it is an enjoyable romp that lets deniro do something different but same for a change 
 but it is an impressive achievement ; a mesmerizing 
 but it is an interesting and entertaining diversion through less travelled territory for 
 but it is anything but . the story plays more like theater of the absurd than a movie based on historical facts . the radiantly lovely sandrine kiberlain plays marie-therese 
 but it is fun getting there . the dogs are cute 
 but it is good 
 but it is good for some laughs . reviewed : july 14th 
 but it is handled pretty well here 
 but it is in many ways a victim of its own publicity campaign . so much of the set-up has been revealed in trailers and in print that a lot of the humor which could have arisen from the unexpected and improbable scenario has been defused by our familiarity with the material . imagine 
 but it is in the warm 
 but it is like watching a murder mystery and never finding out who the killer is . we are given clues to something but they are never tied up . in the end we just know more about both arnold and furtwangler . the film is basically a stage play . the visual is not very important . corners are cut visually including touches like filling windows with photographs to avoid having to shoot on location . as with a stage play 
 but it is mox's off field struggle with some of life's complex questions that will sustain the interest . the hunky van der beek will obviously be one of the main attractions for audiences . however 
 but it is not consistent enough . overall 
 but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this . also 
 but it is one of the better celebrity-directed 
" but it is related specifically to this dvd so i must voice this now . one of the music videos on the disc is for a song called "" i need to know "" by a group called r angels . this video features four mid-teenage girls ( the singers obviously ) having a slumber party . the girls ask a ouija board "" i need to know . . . who to do "
" but it is sarossy's film all the way . it creates indelible images of evil . i rate it an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low + 3 on the -4 to + 4 scale . ( i do hope they do not use the tagline "" don't mess with mr . in-between . "" ) "
 but it is still a cut above most dark comedies . unlike many directors 
 but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor . lee plays a quiet shaolin monk who is a martial arts expert . he is approached by interpol official who asks him to join tri-annual martial arts tournament that is held on a remote island 
 but it is their moaning that's more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be . as the second half begins 
 but it is transitory 
 but it isn't hard to surmise that rick's womanizing had a large part in it . whenever he's late to pick up the kids on his visitation days 
 but it isn't really the story that's important here--it's the story * telling * . this is a dynamite action film . director john woo uses techniques--like slow-mo 
 but it kept me entertained for two hours . this is the film that knocked titanic off the top spot on the box office charts earlier last year . the movie adaptation of the schlocky `60s television series . the show was a cheesy bore . the movie version is the same thing 
 but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness . dealing with themes of forbidden love 
" but it lacks the movement and spark that made "" seven years "" such an audience-pleaser . the actors contribute to the realistic feel of the movie ( filmed in morocco for obvious reasons ) . the only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like a wax dummy and moves as if he were a computer-generated character . on an intellectual level "
 but it looks dangerous 
 but it makes even less sense that he would tell a witness . the only other thing that bothered me was the poor editing job performed here . not only are long 
 but it mars an otherwise excellent film . republicans 
 but it matters little--comes a second ticket 
 but it may be a little too hip for its own good . 
 but it may be a theatrical version of wing chun . of her character wai lin in tomorrow never dies 
" but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact . the film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result - you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this "" jungle "" but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations - but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution . there's also a noticeable ( but not too heavy-handed ) thread of social commentary in the big lebowski "
 but it needs to be . the film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads 
 but it never fully establishes batman's psychological motives and underpinnings . in terms of action 
 but it never gets in the way of their professional relationship . they are like a couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street . there might be some romantic interest 
 but it never quite comes off because it's simply too melodramatic and conventional . herskovitz tries with all his might to make it a nailbiter 
 but it never seemed like one could really understand the characters on a deeper level . for example 
 but it provides a nice addition to the film . the plot is terrific- somewhat . the setup is nice with the film actually starting with a victory in the courtroom . then the case that will make or break jan ( travolta ) 's career rears its ugly head . they find out the goldmine involved with the case and wind up taking it . however 
 but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics to be a science . most all other films we normally classify as science fiction 
 but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here . but on its own terms 
 but it seems that he is not happy with the final product 
 but it seems that he just isn't cut out for the job . on the set of his current film that he stars in 
 but it seems to me that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction ( although much less cynical ) . but no matter . . . jackson is very strong in his role . robert de niro is actually a little annoying at times 
 but it should be an example of what works and what doesn't . will smith's character is 
 but it soon becomes apparent that they know something that grace does not . to make matters worse 
 but it still can be fun . brosnan plays a wealthy art lover named thomas crown who steals expensive paintings because 
 but it still is fun . if you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today 
 but it still manages to be funny 
 but it still provides the viewer with a solid 
" but it still raises expectations about that "" truth "" too high . if this were the whole film "
 but it still retains its most endearing value . each of the roles has an everyman quality 
 but it still shows it very realisticaly . now the titanic is both a story on its own and a backdrop for a story . it serves as both admirably 
 but it succeeds at what it's meant to be . . . an enjoyable 
 but it sure is an entertaining ride for the duration of its running time . - copyright 2001 by dustin putman http : //us . imdb . com/reviewsby ? dustin + putman http : //www . atnzone . com 
 but it surprisingly turns out that way . the amount of light 
 but it takes a suprising ( and disarming ) turn towards mediocre filmmaking . i've always felt that it goes down too easily 
 but it takes awhile for her to return his affections . vivian also helps him see through buying another family owned company by bringing out the more emotional side of him . pretty woman is extremely cute . cute is the only world for it . i also liked the fact that prostitutes are portrayed as people that need help ( much in the same way that african-american gangsters were showcased in slam . ) the film turns in fine performances by it's two leads 
 but it thankfully never resorts to preaching 
 but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict with the ship's crewmembers who strive to maintain order and assure that the first-class passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else . in this way 
 but it turns out to be pretty fun . the turtles all have discernable personalities 
 but it turns out to be some male character we aren't even introduced too ! that's careless filmmaking 
 but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated . like tarantino 
 but it was a very enjoyable movie . secondly 
 but it was one of the most enjoyable cinematic experiences i've had in a long time . and 
 but it will be remembered by me as one of the year's best . a review by akiva gottlieb 
" but it will certainly have an effect . i know i will certainly hear "" hip to be square "" in a different context the next time i hear it . [r] reviewed by brian matherly - bmath2000@hotmail . com the jacksonville film journal - http : //www . jaxfilmjournal . com/ "
 but it will lightly touch both 
 but it wont be a blockbuster . it should keep some people just entertained . it is a very simple movie 
 but it works here because the film knows how to get our attention quickly . it's not about the payoff because it's obvious bond will escape 
 but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule . critic's note #2 : reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics' law of reviewing movies 
 but it's a clever 
" but it's a decent movie and it showcases the coens' ability to handle suspense and violence in a visceral but non-exploitative manner . i would firmly recommend it to all "" coen-heads "" as well as anyone looking for something original in a thriller . "
 but it's a heck of a good one . many of my friends have a respect bordering on a religious obsession with it . ( my friend adam - who thinks that rotj is the best of the trilogy and tesb is the worst - owns paperback continuations of the movies and soundtracks meant to be played along as you read . ) the film certainly has a place in my heart although i'm not sure i love it as much as they . watching it today i feel manipulated . it hold up over numerous viewings and yet . . . something is missing . to many remaking star wars is what remaking casablanca ( they're doing it ! ) and the godfather is to me : sad and pointless . it would ruin the legend of the movie . yet . . . i'll say it against my better judgment ( and it will anger many people . ) if it's done do it with a new script . have steven spielberg direct . use new music . set it in the future . get rid of the first line ( along time ago in a galaxy far far away . . . ) . cast jack nicholson as darth vader and get rid of the clunky outfit . wait till i get to hollywood ! bwa 
 but it's a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness . cage is a wonderfully versatile actor ( think face/off 
 but it's a safe bet that a good chunk of them have seen his movies . if we are to believe the semi- biographical gods and monsters 
 but it's a very very funny comedy that keeps us entertained until the end credits which themselves are funny too . it has all it needs to be a breezy entertaining comedy : the acting is up to pace and some of the performances quite funny 
 but it's a wonderful surface to look at . good show all around . now let's see chow -- and fuqua -- in something a little more substantial . i * know * chow can handle it . 
" but it's also a smart look at how men and women see the same events with varying eyes . there has yet to be a live-action musical sequence that rivals the one-two punch of "" you're the one that i want "" and "" we go together "
 but it's also a tragic one 
 but it's also brutally phony 
 but it's also easily gwyneth paltrow's best recent performance . when helen ( paltrow ) screams that her unfaithful boyfriend is a 'shagging wanker 
 but it's also more entertaining . it broadens its horizons 
 but it's also perfect family entertainment and relentlessly entertaining . i haven't had such a good time at the movies in months . it tells the story of an ant named flick ( voice by dave foley ) ; he's a nice guy 
 but it's also so dry 
 but it's also undoubtedly welcome . the spy who shagged me is one of the most unrestrained 
 but it's an entertaining way to finish the film . plus

 but it's certainly worth a matinee price . rated r 
 but it's definitely original when all put together as done here . the thing i liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in which it was taking place . it's 1968 and these dudes are looking good ! yes 
 but it's disney-ized 
 but it's downright touching . the script 
 but it's easy to shrug off once you've left the theater . the only sequence that has the chance to be truly indelible is veronica being pulled in front of the hypocrisy of the inquisition and threatened with the death penalty for her transgressions 
 but it's enough to throw a nod in the general direction of rod serling for wrapping up his ideas in half-hour time slots 
 but it's every bit as treacly . the opening moments of deep impact offer more to snicker at . the cheesiness is not confined to the disaster movie conventions 
 but it's fun ! yes 
 but it's got so much surprise substance packed inside that i'm encouraging everyone to go see it . in fact 
 but it's hysterical when we find out . charlie's sessions with his therapy group are fairly amusing 
 but it's in the naked faces of fearless actors mark rylance ( angels & insects ) and kerry fox ( welcome to sarajevo ) that the tender ache of emotional resonance is discovered . with sharp 
 but it's just not the deep experience the filmmakers want you to believe it is . and neither was titanic . that ought to guarantee me plenty of hate mail for the next few weeks . fire away . 
 but it's just oddly placed 
 but it's just too damn cute not to watch once a year . especially when olive wags that little tail . that's great . 
 but it's kimberly elise

 but it's long ) is a silent man ( bokeem woodbine ) who 
 but it's much more easy to understand . his previous film needed a second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation 
 but it's nearly three hours long . although the interest level is high throughout the first two hours 
 but it's never really deepened enough . oh well . well 
 but it's not a bad film at that . in fact 
 but it's not completely bad either . the wife of the title is josie potenza ( played nicely by halle berry ) . she is married to tony ( christopher mcdonald . . . you know 
 but it's not hard to see how a woman using violence against a man in the late sixties 
 but it's not quite larger than life . this isn't a problem per se 
" but it's not something i would say is merely "" ok "" to watch . in case you don't know "
 but it's not the story that sets the film above others of its kind 
 but it's obvious who's in the center of attention . so 
 but it's often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom . the result is sometimes surprising 
 but it's only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film . instead of creating the great woody allen world 
 but it's pretty darn close . ( michael redman has written this column for over 22 years and as soon as he finishes this one 
 but it's probably not something most other audience members would want to experience first-hand . all this aside 
 but it's probably the best analogy that i can come up with right now ; you know how when you see a spider or something in your toilet 
 but it's quickly abandoned . yet once again this year 
 but it's scarlett johansson as grace who shines in a more difficult role . dianne wiest 
 but it's served up with a good sense of fun and a fast-moving camera . and of course 
 but it's shiny 
 but it's so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from 'based on' to 'suggested by . ' along those same lines 
 but it's something i used to wonder about when i was younger . i can't decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat 
 but it's sometimes ambitious to a fault . wang serves up so many slices of life in the film that it's hard to digest them all . for instance 
 but it's still a thrill seeing the queen of the silent film era handling a shotgun . do yourself favor and don't miss this if it comes to a nearby theater . note : a series of revealing 
 but it's still great fun . most movies that feature martial-arts action are about the giving and receiving of violent pain . jackie has a slightly goofier agenda 
 but it's still the gospel truth . maybe during next awards season 
 but it's the same story . and sometimes 
 but it's the supporting stable that gives the movie its offbeat charm . cusack plays a free-lance reporter sent to savannah to write a fluff story for town & country magazine about one of eccentric millionaire spacey's parties . lots of food 
 but it's too technical . it's too cold and not as fascinating or exciting as it could be . it casts will smith 
 but it's truly an alternative to your typical sci-fi/action flick or lame juvenile comedy . aside from the intentionally cheesy gore 
 but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled . helpfully 
 but its an effective one nonetheless and she aquits herself well . as director 
 but its close . also 
 but its humour won't appeal to everyone . to be specific 
 but its story could even be retold today in modern form 
 but jackie brown is very simply to follow 
 but judging from the audiences' reaction 
 but just how what an incredibly different movie it was going to be . well now its out all over and has gotten some mixed reviews . let me tell you something ladies and gentlemen 
 but just not totally witty ) 
 but just once 
 but just parts of a whole new look at the novel 
 but just taps into our sense of the fantastic . for example 
 but just the image of someone walking down a sidewalk says it all . the relationship that results between judith and pat is true-to-life and sincere . as we watch these two people talk 
 but kaye has found the right note for his material . because american history x is a mainstream film 
 but keep in mind what the movie is and if you are not fond of will smith's form of humor then i wouldn't go . originally written after original release . totally rewritten december 26 
 but keeps getting interrupted by a woman ( sandra oh ) in search of her husband . her husband 
 but kermit is humiliated at the idea and spends the movie avoiding him and his assistants . the trip continues 
 but kirkpatrick doesn't belabor the point . he trusts that his audience is intelligent enough to figure these things out for themselves ; i wish other movies had this kind of faith . parents will also be glad to learn that 
 but laced with a touch of optimism . the acting 
 but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character 
 but lambeau tracks him down . unfortunately 
 but larger and presumably more nasty . it has a crocodile's head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright . perhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs . sometimes they just move too fast to see . occasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision . a few times we get unconvincing matte shot 
" but last year's film "" the game "" got it damn perfect : it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human being "
 but later is isn't ) . the setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself . sayles knows how to bring a location to life 
 but later will become major players to the film's makeup - another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be . once the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle . when the title screen `ronna' is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene 
 but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds . neo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely 
 but leaves the question open . is the man at the golf course spying on wigand 
 but lemmon ( one of the best actors of his generation ) handles the role with grace . azaria 
 but let's cut iarritu some slack here . el chivo lurks throughout the other two stories 
 but let's face it--people want to see it . so why not give it to them ? neve campbell 
 but levy particularly stands out . these characters are portrayed with such saddening realism that you can't help but love them 
 but like a bystander at a traffic accident 
 but longer and with bigger stars 
 but loving older sister ( kelly mcgillis ) . ultimately 
 but lyne found the perfect collaborator in former vanity fair film critic stephen schiff 
 but macdowell stands out in what is probably the main character . she is always a very winning actress 
 but makes up with it by acknowledging its status as essentially an update of donald siegel's 1956 classic invasion of the body snatchers 
 but maybe also one of the best . he's that good . 
 but melvin is a pain in every other way too . he's a champion people-insulter and 
 but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good 
 but messageable song 
 but michele retorts that if it is so easy 
 but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot . the story unfolds slowly and always believably . each little aspect has its own fascination . as mitchell interviews wendell and rita walker 
 but morally he was to blame . irons plays him to a cold perfection 
 but more importantly 
 but most moviegoers will do well to wait for the dvd . 
 but most of the thomas crown affair feels somewhat stiff . the actors and scenery are pretty 
 but most will probably get a kick out of them like my brother and i did . besides 
" but moving performance as marco's uncle . "" dangerous beauty "" is marshall herskovitz's sophomore directorial effort "
" but much of it feels like a lighter version of scenes depicted in more intense inner-city films like "" boyz'n'hood "" ( 1991 ) and "" menace ii society "" ( 1993 ) . "" bulworth's "" chief liability is beatty's insistence on having his character adopt a clumsy style of rap as his new communication device . instead of speaking at political rallies "
 but mulan overdoes it . the overdose of humor turns what could have been a powerfully great film into a good 
 but murphy fuels it . this is a summer-time comedy that 
 but must be allowed to make mistakes 
 but mutates into something much closer to the heart -- and features gene hackman in a typically excellent performance . some movies lead you wrong 
 but my mouth burst open with at least a delighted guffaw at least every couple of minutes . and i think i'm the kind of person that laughs least at movies 
 but neither has had much success . their last bout pitted them against each other and was a draw 
 but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong . lambeau 
 but neither the mistake nor the way he learns from it is what it initially appears to be . in the end 
 but never his composure . for most of its 2-plus hour running time 
 but never lose the viewer . zero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well . zero's relationship with gloria is low-key 
 but never seems exploited as the movie's comic relief or out of place in a basically serious movie . there are also a fair share of courtroom scenes 
 but never stellar 
 but never totally riveting as cinema 
" but never totally thrilling or overly brilliant . "" enemy of the state "" is the same way : it's engrossing for its entire running time "
 but never with this kind of star charisma . 
 but nicholson is such good fun that the running time passes by pretty quickly . overall 
" but no -- winterbottom and screenwriter laurence cordiat know that most of us don't end a typical weekend by stumbling into life-changing experiences . "" wonderland "" is such an acute observance of people that it makes us confront our essential feelings about our fellow man . and to any foreigners out there "
 but no less remarkable 
 but none interesting enough to warrant any attention in this review . they come and go 
 but none of the dialogue is crap 
 but none of them are so jarring that you lose the suspension of disbelief . hopefully the borrowers will surpass the curse of being labeled a children-only movie 
 but nonetheless 
 but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film . one can sense the frustration that norton's character feels when harrelson's free-talking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind 
 but not _quite_ good enough . after embarrassing his instructor's assistant by beating him roundly 
 but not a masterpiece 
 but not amazing like she usually is ( although she meshes well with the film ) . of course 
 but not because it is poorly written . on the other hand 
 but not because it's boring . the cast has a great deal of fun with the bounteous material they're given . bridges exudes a likeable 
 but not before the murder is caught on a naturalist's camera . by an extremist chain of events 
" but not before they urinate on his rug . the dude assumes that these "" collection agents "" were after another jeff lebowski "
 but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes 
 but not crack up funny ones . home fries is a cute 
 but not everyone has fully bought into the idea . charlie ( phillips ) is full of bluster about why she loves hip-hop 
 but not for their parents who identified the culprit : water polluted --better yet 
 but not great director . however 
 but not in the film long enough . finally 
 but not least - an incredible media support 
 but not necessarily in * this * film . the romantic angle 
 but not outstanding . but in combination with the horror aspect 
 but not quite vague either . enjoyment of this movie doesn't require knowledge of film history 
 but not so long that i began glancing at my wristwatch . the fact that these sequences are accompanied by gorgeous fiddle music composed by lynch's frequent collaborator angelo badalamenti doesn't hurt 
 but not so much as to be annoying . smith is also good 
 but not so much that it seems exploitative . herskovitz is also aided by a strong supporting crew 
 but not support her team at the junket or in interviews ; this sort of arrogance is commonplace for ms . polley 
 but not that short . it's a worthy effort 
" but not that you could tell . the other major "" dramatis persona "" is carol ( hunt ) "
 but not their only secret 
 but not to fans of sandra bullock 
 but not too futuristic as to alienate viewers . as we look at the designs 
 but not weak . she remains a captivating actor 
 but not without need . what to do ? it hits our main character gaz ( robert carlyle ) as he notices the large crowds of women who pour into a local male strip club on a regular basis . it seems that simple : take it off and bring in the cash . eventually 
 but not worth all the hype . 
 but nothing came of it ( makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating 
 but nothing else has changed -- no computer-generated backgrounds 
 but now hardly faster than my own computer ) i remember being 12 and watching this at the cinema . it was very efficent at giving you a scare in those days and that hasn't changed . of course 
 but nowhere near as effective . the actual gladiator battles are thrilling 
 but occasionally also rises to the occasion 
 but oh how the times have changed . ) this dramatic shift in focus is most likely the result of louis farrakhan replacing david duke as executive producer of the bond series . that's not the only replacement we see in live and let die . roger moore replaces sean connery as 007 
 but oh so sweet . it's almost too little too late . example : one of the parallel stories follows a young buck ( gael garca bernal ) attempting to raise money to run away from home with his beloved sister-in-law ( vanessa bauche ) . he finds a financially lucrative solution in pitting the family pet in a series of blood soaked dogfights . for all its combustive energy 
 but old enough to recognize that the process of crossing into adulthood robs life of the simple joy that only children can experience . the acting is strong and believable . the mixture of veteran performers and first-timers is effective 
 but on an absolute scale 
 but on some plays that she has been writing . but andy is just like all of the other men out there . when a publisher signs her to a fraud contract and a friend puts her on a television show discussing homosexuality where the host makes fun of her 
 but on the other hand she's jealous of them as a couple . a clear solution presents itself to kate when she realizes that millie is very sick - dying 
 but once again the stage-influenced execution sets it apart 
 but once runaway bride gets into a natural flow 
 but once the creatures break free 
 but once the two play together they instantly bond . stuart however is missing something 
 but once things got out into the deserted area ( and the final battle sequence ) 
 but one has to respect his strength as an artist . by re-evaluating the arthurian legends and making them his own 
 but one note 
" but one that i fear most will miss . many people who saw "" seven years in tibet "" will have a "" been there "
 but one that is filled with dread . helped along by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton and tom epperson 
 but one that is very different in its approach to the material ) . in one of the movie's best scenes 
 but one that will actually listen to him . since whale lives with only his loyal 
 but one thing is certain -- with spielberg's rousing 
 but one which could carry over into reality . surprisingly 
 but one which fits in well . and 
 but only had room for 90% 
 but only in his exclusive section ( the final third of the film ) does the heart and soul of amores perros emerge . retribution is not seen as an easy mark 
 but only the truly great ones are able to define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the characters do . therefore 
 but only under duress 
 but ordell isn't nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction . in addition to looking fantastic 
 but osnard knows his secret : the tailor is an ex-con who served five years in prison after torching his uncle's shop in an insurance scam . he also knows that harry is up to his ears in debt 
 but other than his uncanny resemblance to taye diggs 
 but other times they don't ( i . e . the fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job after dropping $30 
 but out of his own fear and paranoia . a lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper-thin stereotypes and figure the kids won't mind 
 but out of love 
 but over the past few years 
 but overall entertaining fare . 
 but overall he does a good job as one of ordell's perspective clients and friends . robert forster gives one of the best performances in the film 
 but overlong 
 but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will . put simply 
 but perhaps not from india . the photography is colorful and the music is very agreeable . rating : 7 ( 0 to 10 ) 
 but phoenix never lets the character get silly . it's a very good ( and very creepy ) performance . oliver reed died during the filming of gladiator 
 but phoenix's portrayal is more subtle . commodus' burgeoning madness is manifested largely through his body language 
 but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king 
 but pleasant

 but spends the whole time watching his own performance in the mirror ; rather than arousing 
 but stays afloat because of some interesting scenes 
 but stern . it is an impressively assured and nuanced performance . precious time is stolen from the movie's 155 minutes running time by an unengaging subplot involving one the king's concubines ( bai ling ) and her love of a commoner . it strikes with the subtlety of siam's fabled white elephant as it stomps through the leisurely paced story . some may be put off by the action filled climax of the movie . although a bit inconsistent in tone from the rest of the film

 but still can't get his life in order . these factors combine to create many a scene in which men are trying to express emotions and mistakes to one another 
 but still evokes the element of the unknown 
 but still fares better than many of today's lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video . at least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate . notting hill's grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the all-time greatest film pairings 
 but still good fun .

 but thankfully never does . the coens ( joel directed 
 but thanks to some stellar work by mr . downey jr . 
 but that alone is not enough . the story is brought out with a certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective . movies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency . the attention to detail that was paid is remarkable . the whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting 
 but that hasn't prevented columbia pictures from trotting out a lavish period drama more befitting of the winter oscar-bait season . bille august's high-profile adaptation of victor hugo's classic les miserables delivers everything one would expect from a classy hollywood epic--handsome production values 
 but that is dispensed with quickly . the story takes clooney and kidman across the globe 
 but that is not the whole point of this movie . the main duty of the mib is to police the extra terrestrials on earth who have chosen it as a home or a refuge . that's also the main point of this movie : protect the earth from the scum of the galaxy . some of the scum from space is awfully bad and just down right nasty . color commentary abounds when forced to deal with alien scum and none other than will smith and tommy lee jones are there to deliver the punch . the dialogue is witty to say the least . this wittiness lets the movie flow well from scene to scene developing the characters to the extent needed for this movie . tommy lee jones ( as k ) and will smith ( as j ) provide both the action and the comedy beautifully . the characters they play don't seem to be wrong in any way nor does their performance as them . i would have to say that k is more amusing than j 
 but that is saying a lot 
 but that kind of groveling and desperation brings shame on her family . that's chinese culture for you . . . so imagine how embarrassed the family is the next day when they find mulan has stolen her father's uniform and sword and run off to join the army in his place . the movie in a nutshell is about the stuggles of being a woman in the army . it should have been called g . i . chang . mulan calls on her ancestors for help . they decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her 
" but that missing element is what prevents this from being a four-star film . director james l . brooks ( "" terms of endearment "" "
 but that only shows how long ago 1962 was . small children could watch this without being corrupted . kim novak is as lovely as always in this movie 
" but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time . "" the iron giant "" holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience "
 but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who haven't seen the film . perhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability 
 but that's a tough standard to meet . ellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by a strange array of father figures . her real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film but love his daughter unconditionally . drumlin comes across as a distant stepfather to whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to get into trouble . hadden obviously has affection for ellie 
" but that's about it . jackie brown's lone "" innovation "" is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives . this isn't exactly an original technique  it has been done numerous times before "
 but that's just because many journalists feel obliged to make unfounded attacks on the director

" but that's not important right now . "" if you've seen the film "

 but that's pretty much the point . they only had what they had and the rest is in their memories . so it is for the viewer 
 but that's what keeps it all so interesting . the second storyline starts at the same moment as ronna's story 
 but that's what makes it escapist and fun . relax 
 but that's what the bond series is based on . for ( i think ) 18 films 
 but thats the point . it is heathers fear and despondence 
 but the 1991 bret easton ellis novel upon which the film is based is notorious for having been read by karla homolka 
" but the acting is top-notch . matthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his "" pretty boy "" image to become baldwin "
 but the action and suspense makes you forget all about that . daylight is a great film 
 but the action is so extraordinary that it is clear director/co-writer jonathan mostow completed his ultimate goal ; to blow the audience's socks off . set during the early stages of world war 2 when the united states struggled to break the codes of the technologically advanced german u-boats 
 but the actors are in top form . the 2nd act of this film struggles valiantly to hold the viewer's attention . the director is john mctiernan 
 but the actors smooth it over with their good-hearted style . typical of the scenes that come out of nowhere is the one in which a rotund benjamin franklin appears in a large pot of hot water 
 but the actual course of actions is always fascinating . for a while everyone has their fun 
 but the actual problem they are fighting for is never fully explored . it left me somewhat confused 
 but the appeal of this film is almost universal : if you've ever read a play by shakespeare 
 but the arrival is a better movie than usual 
 but the artwork is outstanding . from its beautiful handdrawn images to the three-dimensional computer-generated work 
 but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro . of course 
 but the audience gets to her first 
 but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it . for a couple of hours 
 but the comparison is interesting . as i have acknowledged before 
 but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities 
 but the desert night of nevada 
 but the direction is still outstanding . although the film is very long 
 but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama . it is emotionally engaging 
 but the ending seems to be too much to handle . but true crime is a film definitely worth seeing 
 but the enormous possibilities are never quite explored . after the engaging beginning 
 but the entire opening scene is voiced-over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting . mike's about to go up against teddy kgb ( malkovich ) 
 but the evidence is stacked against her . and swayze wants to reach moore 
 but the extent to which it has been hidden . it's a slightly more interesting angle 
 but the fact that anything manages to touch the heart is high achievement in a genre generally more concerned with effects . situations that initially feel contrived 
 but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief . fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth 
 but the film asks us to find the scene between them touching and sad . it's just a mindless way to inject more conflict for virgil than was necessary . instead 
 but the film does 
 but the film doesn't view them as such 
 but the film is surprisingly dreary and dismal . jekyll/hyde ( john malkovich ) is terminally depressed and desperate . mary reilly ( julia roberts ) is a victim of monstrous child abuse and the anti-woman sentiment of the times . director stephen fears' version of the london slums makes us marvel that anyone survived them . the lighting level is exceedingly low throughout the movie : it almost appears to be filmed in black and white . the direction and cinematography are brilliant and liquid . scenes flow into the next scene like honey oozing off a strawberry . ( except there's no red 
 but the film soon collapses under the weight of convention 
 but the film suddenly veers towards an introspective and melodramatic tone . floating life shifts its focus away from the exploits of the new immigrants and towards bing's domineering of her newly-reunited family 
 but the film suffered because of it . visually 
 but the film's staying power is based on word of mouth . allow me to spread some more good buzz for notting hill . grant stars as william thacker 
 but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes . this is an example of the final act saving the film 
 but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband 
 but the general feeling is one of confusion . brando mumbles his lines in a incoherent stir 
 but the gore 
 but the heart of the people vs . larry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea . larry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff 
 but the hicks who find the two black men suspect him immediately 
 but the inclusion of these images would have left a greater impression . tennant also lets the actors move within the scene without letting the camera move with them 
 but the indian setting makes a great deal of difference . director mira nair calls the film an affirmation of life . i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low + 2 on the -4 to + 4 scale . 
 but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived . each person may be a comic caricature 
 but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun . 
 but the lack of a real 2nd act nearly sinks it . the actors are charming 
 but the lawyer is never particularly well-defined outside of his role in the la amistad case . likewise 
 but the little mermaid was a revolution in the disney world 
 but the lives of these doctors are intriguing enough to warrant a document of their stories . 
 but the main attraction is the movie's glossy look . chow yun-fat commands the screen the way very few actors do 
 but the main focus here is on the first ( and longest ) tale 
 but the majority of the film is incredibly and unnecessarily melodramatic . as for the actors 
 but the majority of the film is subdued-and singer's handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murderer-in-training . mckellan's and renfro's performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film ; while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellan's finely-tuned realization 
 but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun . what is reality ? what is a sham ? the film turns our very perception of life on its side . more than once 
 but the more he was around 
 but the movie itself 
 but the movie tries something neat and for the most part makes it . who'd've thunk it : a date movie about mk-ultra ? 
 but the movie truly excels in its script . life is beautiful is a self-proclaimed fable 
 but the movie ups its fascinating ante by contrasting their wildly different ways of winning . any sequence where the two men sit at the table together is an unarguable highlight . if only the other character interaction was as successful 
 but the music and live performances from the band 
 but the nature of their trade is such that their off-stage jokes are always obvious . buddy 
" but the one thing it couldn't thieve was the original's abstract charms . this latest incarnation from arrow will probably- -like the rescored "" metropolis "" a few years back--turn a silent film into more palpable entertainment for the latest generation of film freaks . "
 but the one who steals the show is undoubtedly de niro . the greatest actor of all time in my opinion 
 but the one-man show by dreyfuss 
" but the party is a delightful movie that incorporates very well played out comedy into believable situations . it also includes a number of memorable scenes ( can anyone say "" birdy num-num "" ? ) . if you're in the mood for fun and enjoyable slapstick comedy "
 but the performances and tight direction from raimi ( who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film 
 but the performances are all great . in fact 
 but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout ( although the payoff is a letdown ) . tarantino keeps things moving along nicely 
 but the poker itself is only a metaphor for a much larger picture . the road to true fulfillment lies within the realization and exercising of your natural passions 
" but the pop psychology of hunting reaches such a high level of annoyance so that when williams tearfully confronts damon with the film's signature line of -- i kid you not -- "" it's not your fault "
 but the presentation almost makes you forget the plot and character lapses . the final light-saber battle 
 but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security . . . and it apparently helps if you're drunk while you're doing it . genuine or not 
 but the public likes it's mainstream trash . hogarth hughes is an adventurous young boy living in rockwell 
 but the question of which of these wins is still in the air . it's 1973 
 but the reason he's not great is because he's too technical and calculated . his shots are perfectly executed 
 but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together . the story is well-thought out ( and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place ) 
 but the rest of the audience didn't seem to be in on it . don't go see wild things expecting a run-of-the-mill suspense film . ( it's an amusing exercise in sleaze populated with comically self-absorbed 
 but the rest of the film is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the film's thematic elements : the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor 
 but the role of justin matisse could have beem cut down a little bit . all in all 
 but the scenes fall way short of expectations . granted 
 but the script peters out where it counts the most -- at the end . the big finale that we hope we'll get doesn't have the passion and humility of the rest of the film 
 but the second hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes and a sweet ending . quinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez and the real jackal 
 but the self-awareness of the excess just adds to the fun . no 
 but the senator plans to bury the bill in committee . reynolds has the senator offed 
 but the sets deserve most of the credit . the sets are very well done 
 but the setting conveys a sense of claustrophobia and isolation which makes it clear that there is already no way out for wigand . he has to make his choice and bear the consequences 
 but the shock of winning killed the poor old man 
 but the show is just as funny and doesn't cost $7 . 75 and an otherwise good friday or saturday night . the positive end of this almost-dead battery does have some traits of which to boast . in a time where they are rare 
 but the sincerity in cole's anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures . he will instead pursue the supernatural angle 
 but the slapstick is kept tightly under control by writer and director manny coto so that one never feels embarrassed to be laughing . the romantic angle is handled ever so delicately . when cy wishes to know if spencer wants to mate with the object of his desire 
 but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property . in a sense 
 but the small gang of rogues 
 but the story is totally blown on one-dimensional goofball characters 
 but the story isn't about her . however 
" but the story maintains its focus on chris and his search for the love of his life . "" we're soul mates ! "" chris exclaims . heaven "
 but the surplus of emotion makes up for the lack of plot . the film features two outstanding performances from elodie bouchez and natacha regnier 
 but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon's full-frontal nude scene . it's very brief 
 but the things he seems to be doing aren't exactly on the up-and-up either . and therein 
 but the truly remarkable achievement is that after a while 
 but the truth is that his new novel just isn't finished yet ; it is now two thousand single-spaced pages long and counting . tripp 
 but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene . there are too many questions left unanswered with the character of kurtz to have a satisfying ending . the finest scene at the end is sheen's escape 
 but the walls of water 
 but the way sommers tells it is entertaining enough . the special effects from industrial light and magic are top notch 
 but their new film 
 but their problems are real 
 but their relationship is convolutedly interrupted too many times ( four weddings' suffered similar flaws ) 
 but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film . in most films only a few characters exist for support in background 
 but then a funny thing happens-- he hits some guy on the run from bad guys . the guys try to help out this stranger they've nearly killed 
 but then again 
 but then again .1
 but then again it should be expected . bulworth 
 but then again the film in the theatre was dark too . sound- * * * * incredible . the film has 3 ch . english dolby surround 5 . 1 
 but then again you're not really supposed to - braddock knows the audience is in on the joke 
 but then i realized that everything turned out the way it should have . if this had been a typical hollywood film 
 but then it would have just been gratuitous . restraint was shown where necessary 
" but then ponders if this was actually the right decision . "" gattaca "" came out only a couple months following the first genetically engineered creature "
 but then slowly turns into a different sort of story 
 but then the film makes no bones about the fact that it keeps dippily dipping into the past 
 but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky 
 but then you could probably wait until it comes out on video so that you forward past some of the boring parts . little known facts : this film will always be remembered as the movie that knocked titanic ( 7/10 ) out of the top spot at the box-office after 15 straight weeks at number one . garry oldman is british 
 but there are a few missed opportunities in the final scenes . but my quibbling is not important . what is important is that i acknowledge the quality of this picture 
 but there are a lot of little things . the movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in 35 
 but there are more than enough twists in how the story is told to make it interesting and enjoyable . the acting is of high caliber and seems deserved of praise . all in all this movie takes you back into history 
" but there are occasions when ponderous lines like "" i like the night sometimes you come face to face with yourself "" become a little hard to swallow . in addition "
 but there are some amazing battlefield shots . eddie murphy pulls off some good one-liners 
" but there are still problems that are reflected in this film . but there is more to the film than its racial aspect . the legacy of "" sweet sweetback's baadasssss song "" is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the african-american perspective "
 but there are two serious problems : first 
 but there aren't any superheroes . instead 
 but there aren't many of these . even with its problems 
 but there is a problem . bernice is not very pleasant any more due to justin . she is extremely angry at her mother for the break up with bill . bernice blames the entire thing on birdee . hope floats is a realistic tale of what one can go through throughout their lives . birdee goes through tragedy after tragedy 
 but there is actually someone better in a civil action . robert duvall is also an underrated actor . he gets many leading roles 
 but there is always a respectful self-acceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension . the characters are firmly established 
 but there is little push behind the initial story . everything seems to meander along slowly until the last fifteen minutes 
 but there is not a poor performance in the entire movie . lynch is successful in coaxing just the right note out of all his cast 
" but there is only the barest of reflections . "" there is simply nothing there "
 but there is too much of the plot to give away ) . rounding out the cast are jake busey as angus 
" but there it is . if there were ever a clear case for "" less is more "
 but there was 
 but there was no subtlty to his efforts . raimi does a fine job of tying in a fox in a chicken coop and birds of prey to signify the future of the characters . i think most viewers may miss the comparison 
 but there's a startling scene midway which has them in bed slowly working their way toward orgasm . this is not the sex of hollywood gloss 
 but there's also some melodramatic romantic spice . ornery 
 but there's no place like home 
" but there's no question that he makes some of the most entertaining and audience-friendly ones . "" it's not bach "
 but there's nothing at all underneath . reviewed as part of our coverage of the 24th annual mill valley film festival . 
 but there's nothing substantial to bring them all together . the main story seems to be the fact that rafael wants to 'buy' california using gold stolen from the guy he's buying the land off . this sets up for a temple of doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven into getting the gold from little mines . however 
 but there's one thing about deep impact i underestimated : the skills of director mimi leder . she won an emmy for her helming work on nbc's smash er 
 but there's still been a great deal of condensation and collapsing . i went back and read the entire series myself -- the scope of the whole story is staggering 
 but there’s considerably less blood 
 but these are in pastels rather than screaming colors . from photography to editing

 but these are typically either in dubbed 
 but these types of simple approaches are never taken . the first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war . fleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is . one scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming

 but they are always done very well and believably . his hitmen are normally cruel 
 but they are by far the least interesting . walsh is a nonentity 
 but they are certainly playful enough to hold most viewers' interest . as is the animation 
 but they are not judged . judging the characters in this picture would be a creative misstep on the filmmakers' parts 
 but they are rather excellent ; the `wall of sand' effect towards the finale is particularly effective . fraser looks surprisingly suited to this newfound role 
 but they both come up with a scheme to throw the feds and cops off their track . this scheme seems to be going as planned 
" but they both deviate from her usual "" intelligently ditzy "" romantic comedy roles "
 but they both turn in believable performances

 but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire . seth's adoration is too much to resist 
 but they do not . we not only feel more involved in the story 
 but they don't drag the movie's humor content down that bad . most of the actors get their job done 
 but they don't just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either . i think that 
 but they don't necessarily take operation desert storm seriously-it's a reprieve from their hellish day jobs . they are gates 
 but they foreshadow things to come . this film starts off on the right foot by establishing the kind of atmosphere that could only be found in an action movie 
 but they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way . the audience does hate them 
 but they had a falling out ten years earlier and haven't spoken since . desperately aware of both lyle's mortality and his own 
 but they have enough in them to get you to care for some of the characters . rob cohen ( dragonheart ) does a great job with this film . 
 but they manage to make a love connection anyway

 but this ain't no little mermaid . the only disney involved here is tim disney 
 but this appears to be one family movie that most members of the family will be able to find agreeable 
 but this film does run a little too long 
 but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance . even people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set . the costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place . the filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside 
 but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking . character development is virtually nonexistent . with the possible exception of qui-gon 
 but this guy is for real . he has a natural screen presence 
 but this is not close's best role . she seems little more than a cardboard cutout character . a beautiful film in its own dreary way . you'll appreciate the filmmaking craft 
 but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works . maybe this is because she's not a very afeminite character 
 but this is probably her most three-dimensional role that she has had ( with a close second being altman's 1993 mosaic 
 but this isn't always evident . most comics are non-stop performers too 
 but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i've seen . titanic tells its story in two time periods . it starts out in the present 
 but this movie packs in knowing performances ( especially by kennedy and cox ) and more death for your dollar . it can be argued that 
 but this one also tosses magic into the mix periodically . of course 
 but this only instills greater remoteness towards the audience . another main fault is the film's script . i'm not to sure that this subject matter should have been handed over to two guys 
 but this review is for people who are highly suspicious of shelling out eight bucks to see a horror flick . the only reason i actually saw the faculty was because my little sister begged me to . but now i'm trying to convince you to . actually 
 but this script is made of lead . instead of clever 
 but this seems purely for show ; they fool around on one another with only the barest of nods toward secrecy . certainly 
 but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead . simon and his three friends head to vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined . the third arc 
 but this time the lack of originality is the downfall . i must admit that it was very suspenseful 
 but this time the scene has switched to miami 
 but this time they want him to plan and execute the coup d'etat against kimba . shannon reluctantly agrees and assembles small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin meticulous preparation for another small war . thing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies 
 but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs . upon its release

 but to tell the truth it doesn't much matter . there could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining . the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into . the dude's bowling buddies walter ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) look like people you'd see on the street but

 but together dealt with the following subjects among a dozen different characters : growing up 
 but tomorrow never dies is nevertheless a solid 
 but too many cliches bog it down . director tamahori has created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts . david mamet's script 
 but trust me 
 but trust me if you stick around and keep your head in it 
 but truthful . the last shot is an especially powerful image . nothing is said 
 but ultimately being a pretty good person ; and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as jude's wife 
 but ultimately each character's guilt 
 but ultimately everything comes together nicely ( although it's not a happy film . . . some moments are understandably gut-wrenching ) . the story is enhanced by some unexpected humor and very realistic performances 
 but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson 
 but underneath all it's crude humor and sexual content is a sweet little love story that is surprisingly involving . it isn't any kind of cinematic classic 
 but understand that the austin powers series 
 but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal . revealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown 
 but unfortunately 
 but unless you've been shacking up with salinger for the past two years 
 but unlike james cameron's debacle 
 but upon my first viewing it seemed rather dissatisfying because it appears a little too contrived 
 but used without the apostrophe 
 but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyone's future . her late grandmother ( rosemary harris ) told her as a child that it was a gift she was given 
 but using his sanitary skills and learning the ways of the west from annie oakley 
 but very fit for a woman who might have mothered children . her eyes flicker and dance 
 but very little actual substance . admittedly 
 but virgil's maladjustment begins to put a strain on their relationship . on the basis of the overall story 
 but was also a philosopher of great renown . he died in 180 and rule passed to his son commodus . the transition was an orderly one ; commodus was recommended to the senate by marcus 
 but was shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy . the movie 
 but was still very intriguing and thought provoking . first of all 
 but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers . the movie has a similar effect 
 but watch him closely during the film's one courtroom scene : his entire performance is in his eyes and his body language 
 but watching how it all came about is certainly entertaining enough . 
 but we 
 but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking . this film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas 
 but we appreciate seeing it . costume designer yvonne blake ( who also appears in the film ) has done an incredible job providing some interesting and colorful costumes . cinematographer eduardo serra 
" but we are sometimes given quick camera cuts from person to person during the courtroom scenes which make things very confusing . "" rules of engagement "" runs a little too long at 127 minutes . i recommend it to fans of tommy lee jones and samuel l jackson since they are both given a chance to shine here . i give the film two and a half out of five stars . comments ? feel free to e-mail them to : johnbeachem@dependentfilms . net for past reviews "
 but we do get close enough to lee and davis' character . lee is obsessed with the phenomenon 
 but we feel like we're seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years . the phantom menace 
 but we identify with cole 
 but we know it has to do with a galaxy as big as a jewel or marble being sought after on earth 
 but we love him anyway 
 but we must employ it with great forethought and caution . ironically 
 but we never understand what she is thinking . perhaps that may be intentional : to place the audience in zero's zone of detachment . but 
" but we see go's wheels turning from its first flash frame to the last . torontonian polley ( of the sweet hereafter ) refused to do publicity for this picture on the basis that she was "" not pleased with "" her turn as the ill-fated cashier . in go "
" but we should not use this as an excuse or an alibi for our own shortcomings . "" "" guantanamera "" was nominated for the golden lion at the 1996 venice film festival and honored at several others . "
 but we think we're watching cusack 
" but we understand all her actions since she's being played by oprah winfrey . it's been well over a decade since her last major performance in "" the color purple "
 but we're finally able to recognize some things on our own . this makes the final 
 but we're still not sure if he's really a good person or not . his character 
 but weir and niccol didn't see it that way . perhaps it's not fair to criticize a movie for what it isn't 
 but well-crafted cinema . it might have been created for the wrong reasons 
 but what ? sometimes the movie feels like a joke . an army of postal workers armed with guns ? considering the headlines of recent years 
 but what ensues is a series of bloody ( and i do mean bloody ) confrontations 
 but what exactly are the particulars of it ? it's very hard to tell . finally 
 but what is a lighthearted romantic comedy for ? this isn't sleepless in seattle 
 but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does . technically 
" but what it also has is a tone that's completely innocent even when it's also remaining perpetually clever . "" antz "" is still the more witty film "
 but what makes it so surprising and frightening is the sound . there was no question as to who the movie's stars would be . even so 
 but what the city they live in 
 but what the hey ? modern comedy comes from its ability to not take its story or its characters seriously . the farrelly brothers and woody allen have taught us that . recent failures like joe dirt and schneider's last film deuce bigalow : male gigolo owe themselves to a seriousness they try to create by treating their main characters as martyrs for the audience to sympathize with and pity . the animal does no such thing 
 but what was usually lacking was a good story . . . and good characters . . . and good acting 
 but what's left in-between leaves something to be desired . 
 but what's new here is a different facet of his storytelling -- a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent 
 but what's one without the other . both roles complemented each other very well and the script seemed to be written for these two actors . the story also goes deep enough to provide a proper background so the audience is not totally clueless . altogether good performances were put in by all the cast and the director blended everything marvelously with the necessary special effects to create a good movie . a movie well worth seeing if you are up for some lighthearted and witty humor . as most movies have their good things they also have their bad things . the character development in this movie was not all that grand because it didn't need to be . but if there was more character development and if there was some development of the alien characters that might have added quite considerable to the movie . especially the evil alien 
 but what's remarkable is how timeless this film is . the film takes place in the late 19th century ( or early 20th - wasn't really sure ) 
 but what's so tough about playing a woman who stumbles around 
 but what's specifically impressive is the fact the characters' names are never revealed until the end credits roll . for the sake of this review 
 but when bunny is apparently kidnapped 
 but when cutbacks led to the elimination of his security position 
 but when duty calls he takes command of the questionable group . guessing who is and isn't the thing is almost impossible

 but when you see this film 
 but whenever the bear is present 
 but where ? are we to believe that the rest of the world is in the same shape and hasn't made their way west to help or conquer ? there is some jumbled symbolism here that doesn't appear to make sense . the tale is obviously saying that communication can defeat evil in much the same way that the internet has the potential to topple governments 
 but where the disc truly shines is in its cannibal ! specific extras . the first thing i must note is 
" but whether or not they would actually act on this temptation is something i'm not sure of . "" gattaca "" warns us not to go any farther "
" but which is exciting and suspenseful nonetheless . "" frequency "" probably won't win any academy awards "
 but while pat starts to form a deep love for her 
 but while pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an r-rated film . some have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc-17 
 but who hates ricky's guts . max has an easy job for bobby ; fly to new york and make a simple delivery to a gangster named ruiz ( a smooth and silky sean combs ) . bobby 
 but why ? is it another coincidence that it takes place in 2013 
 but why the viewers are never told . the entire journey is supposed to be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this god-like kurtz 
 but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together ? what did they ever see in the other person to begin with ? labute never really answers 
 but will doesn't die . this is no formula movie . in fact 
 but with a bit of a lighter heart . ( a scene where he tries to display his anger over the phone and fails miserably is hilarious . ) crystal plays an excellent straight man to deniro's character 
 but with a decent twist involving the main villain 
 but with a light touch . curiously 
 but with a sense of the self-aware 
 but with a small detail involving a certain gift . it's a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear . and by the way

 but wouldn't answering such questions - or even addressing them - give the film a little more dramatic depth ? of course

 but you shouldn't be watching gangster movies if that upsets you . at over two and a half hours in length it's a true epic 
 but you shouldn't forget that this is a movie about a gigolo . deuce bigalow male gigolo will likely make a tidy profit from teens seeking its services on weekend nights . the movie needn't worry about getting rushed out of theatres as it will quickly go in video stores where a significant number of people will probably jerk it off the shelf and take it home for hours of private entertainment . running at close to two hours

 courtroom dramas are not a new topic to hollywood . whether it be john grisham's thrilling novels or television's famous dramas 
 cousine . the plot is complicated 
 cousins is a mix of drama and comedy . the film is larger than life and has a keen sense of the absurd . it understands human nature extremely well and milks it for every possible laugh and heart-tug . how often do you see a movie where you believe that two characters truly and sincerely care for and love each other 
 cousins is an americanized version of a french film : 1975's cousin 
 cousins is just such a movie . let's hope the french continue to provide us with the inspiration to make films like cousins

 creepy stuff ( i don't think i'll ever feel safe in a movie theater again ) that effectively foreshadows the ratio of smart scares and spoofy laughs down the road . another flawless example of this is a riotous cell phone-assault of the killer on randy

 crib the self-rearranging kitchen business from the latter . ) it's far more heartwarming than frightening 
 cries and more fun at the movies this season than probably any other movie . its nice to see a pg rated movie out at christmas that everyone can see . even though it has a $90 million dollar budget i'm sure it will make over that or just below it respectively . for all you parents out there trying to find a good family movie

 disney has decided to re-release the little mermaid theatrically for 17 days ( and 17 long nights ) only . coincidentally 
 disney has decided to turn a movie over to the asians . mulan is set in feudal china and features the ever-popular heroine who marches to a different drum and wants to do more with her life than get married . that's what we find out when young mulan ( voice of ming- na wen ) screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her . cartoons . . . meanwhile

 good will hunting is about the unlikely friendship that develops between a world-weary veteran and a cocky young man . the formula for the two films is similar -- both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life and their place in it -- but the characters are different . al pacino's slade was a larger-than-life individual ; robin williams' sean mcguire is much more subtle . and matt damon's will hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the blandness of chris o'donnell's charlie . will is a troubled individual . as a child

 he was in and out of foster homes on a regular basis . now 
 he was put down because of the threats of genetics 
 he was the frequent victim of abuse . an orphan 
 he was the most straighten face actor . ( then again 
 he was the only characters face we could completely see . ) the film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old beatty to indulge in some rapping

 he winds up at a gothic mansion where a ritualistic ( and frankly 
 he winds up being pursued by two different groups which want to pick his brain 
 he wisely chooses not to overplay the changes father and son have wrought on the present . although some differences are highlighted 
 he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars 
 he would continually share the spotlight 
 he would look at the monk 
 he would probably be one of the best filmmakers around today . instead 
 he would try to comfort annie 
" he wouldn't have been nearly as funny as brendan gleeson in "" i went down . "" gleeson "
 he'll turn into ridley scott . let's hope not . this fresh new filmmaker does make the most of his locations 
 he's a crowd pleaser 
 he's a mobster 
 he's almost in two places at once . during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring . by the film's end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant . the injury ? he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock ! thus 
 he's also a homophobe 
" he's also good at technical directing . he and cinematographr roger deakins created a beautiful world on film . perhaps "" beautiful "" is the wrong word ; nihilists "
 he's also produced some turkeys ) . his chief accomplishment 
 he's always dreamed of becoming a first-class reporter but newspaper manager ollie ( skip homeier ) makes fun of him and won't let him write any stories . luther is driving along when a man is hit over the head in front of the town's spooky old simmons mansion that everyone says is haunted . convinced that they can scare him away from the paper for good

 he's been living in the fictional island town of seahaven 
 he's built up a nice thirty grand nest egg 
 he's busy dumping a neighbor's dog down the garbage chute . he's an equal opportunity bigot . he does venture outside his apartment every day to eat breakfast at a local cafe . melvin is such a grouchy curmudgeon that waitress carol connelly ( helen hunt ) is the only one willing to wait on him . and she's none too happy about it . when carol doesn't show up for work 
 he's caring and he's a dog all the way . the few problems that i did have with this film included the redundant nature of the whole thing at some point ( okay 
 he's christopher walken . he can't compete with the penguin or catwoman 
 he's coming home for a high school reunion 
 he's created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about . and he's fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities 
 he's dan hedaya ) 
 he's either crying or he looks like he has just been crying . phoenix has definitely matured as an actor since to die for 
 he's engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his . her name is melanie ( de havilland ) 
 he's excellent in the role of the demented senator 
 he's far too old now 
 he's generated a good deal of energy in pictures like crimson tide and top gun . that vibrant spirit is present here 
 he's got ambition 
 he's got goals and he loves everything he sees about being the number one gangster . violence 
 he's having another problem 
 he's hollow-eyed 
" he's just like you and me - except that he has the capacity to view the line we'd deem "" far enough "" as the starting mark of some crazy race . meanwhile "
 he's just terrified of not being in a relationship . something shared by almost everyone in the film . the dogs may be in obedience school ( and some of the comedic highlights come from their instructor who firmly believes dogs are better than children ) but it's the owners who need training . they lack any self control and are driven by their passions and fears . of course 
 he's left a big question that is in their minds throughout the film . another problem is we never see anybody panicking . i would imagine if the world was ending 
 he's looking more like his father every day . connelly fine in her role 
 he's making wind-bag speeches that start with the amusingly clintonesqe statement 
 he's managed to attach himself to great scripts ( this one by toby emmerich 
 he's more of a plot convience than a character . although his performance is good 
 he's no invincible superhero who only blurts out one-liners 
 he's no longer just kooky -- he's charged with the convinction that someone really is after him . convincing alice 
 he's not 
 he's not merely a misogynist . setting his sights higher than that 
 he's not only holding an unbroken band 
 he's not so nice 
 he's not so smart 
" he's off to an annual 12 night celebration typically held in freezing weather during a snowstorm . this year it's in the sixties and raining . that wacky el nino . ) [this appeared in the 1/8/98 "" bloomington voice "" "
 he's paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck . when mike's best friend and poker buddy worm ( edward norton ) finishes his jail term for hustling some students 
 he's perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence 
 he's perhaps a little more nervous than she . he does order a cognac to brace himself . their first sexual encounter 
 he's proven himself a bigger talent behind the camera . ordinary people is one of the best films of the nineteen-eighties 
 he's see's a ad for a company called 'rekall' 
 he's smart 
 he's someone you can just look at and laugh . when the film is remade in the us ( with robin williams as the idiot ) it will probably lose all of the charm and the wit that is featured here . the supporting cast is good 
 he's somewhat like a child - panicky 
 he's steals it . he's character is so hateful 
 he's still alive ) 
 he's trying something different--the sure sign of a filmmaker that understands that the learning process never stops . here 
 he's trying to get married and enjoy a quiet honeymoon with his wife ( lisa kudrow ) and kid . and 
 he's very much like yosarian of catch-22 
 he's wooden . ) his no-frills visual style hasn't changed much over the years

 his novels are not only grounded in realism but poetic in nature . they are reminiscent of stephen crane in their blunt eloquence 
 his only advantage the fear he strikes into his victims . no extraordinary leap of faith is needed to believe in the killer . the down side is that if you are frightened by horror movies 
 his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind . the joker's cruelty and demented

" his profession of "" faith "" before the selection committee is so nakedly and transparently insincere that only a pack of idiots should have fallen for it . the last big problem is with the use of real personalities in various roles . the media figures "
 his quietly hushed and sexy vocal style totally absorbing the viewer . the allure of his stage persona compared to the shambles of his personal life is staggering . in one scene 
 his rage and the erosion of his belief system . hartnett is appropriately cool and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies and deceit 
 his role is so insignificant . he has maybe three spoken lines ( believe it or not 
 his second-in-command ) and they form a new pony express dedicated to getting the mail through . the revived postal service doubles as an army to fight the holnists' tyranny . the postman has become a symbol for hope in a rube goldberg manner . although the movie appeals to my sensibilities 
 his seductive smile and his air of boyish innocence . if only death always looked this good then we might be more willing to go quietly into that dark night . meeting joe black is not such a bad experience

 i admit i had a bad attitude about this film from the start . a romantic comedy about the trials and tribulations of single working parents ? with a couple of incredibly cute kids thrown in for good measure ? yuck . but it's not really too bad . it has a lot working against it 
 i almost forgot bill murray's exquisite role as the down-trodden lawyer who agrees to defend dillon in court . murray actually added that extra little spice of humour that allowed this film to affirm its position as a quirky little noirish tale of sex 
 i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his 
 i also saw the trailer for wild things with kevin bacon 
 i always wanted to shout 
 i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet . i am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the world's biggest paid commercial for america online . and i wonder : is that so bad ? well 
 i am convinced that scream has not only revived the teen horror movie and the normal teen romance movies but also the hilarious parodies of these and other categories . films that both deride and celebrate genres like galaxy quest and the big hit would not have existed 
 i am not a big fan of the x-files tv series . i have nothing against it particularly 
 i am not a wonderful judge of acting 
 i am offering this money as a reward on your head 
 i anticipated an anti-pill-popping-casual-tantric-sex-car-chase-attempted-murder sermon that ( blessedly ) didn't arrive . a la tarantino's pulp fiction 
 i began to appreciate and actually like those movies 
 i began to wonder why all science fiction films deal with destructive aliens 
 i believe 
 i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film 
" i can get you off . but not this ship . "" ) the acting is good all around "
 i can hardly complain . 
" i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is . "" jude "" is a satirical film from start to finish about society's way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system "
 i can now say that i liked the x-files pretty well . for us non-fans 
 i can now say that i still enjoyed soldier . this is a movie which attempts to cross genres to create something different . event horizon 
 i can only hope that li will be given a better script next time . the man is incredibly talented 
 i can safely say that john carpenter's vampires 
 i can say that none of my expectations for the film were bashed . okay 
 i can see why so many people bought the book and why it's ripe for criticism . as brandeis university professor morrie schwartz's body deteriorated from lou gehrig's disease 
 i can still say that amadeus was definitely one of the better movies to come out in the 80s . i don't know if it's one of 100 best of all time but it is a very good movie . 
 i can't ask for much more than that . copyright  2000 shannon patrick sullivan . archived at the popcorn gallery 
 i can't fault a made-for-tv movie that has sturdy 
" i can't imagine anyone playing a grotesque character like this . the other major flaw with the film is the amount of time spent on the ending . the movie could have ended fifteen minutes earlier than it does with no problem . one more thing i must note is that "" the whole nine yards "" is definitely a guy movie . nearly every guy in the theatre i attended was laughing uproariously at the movie "
 i can't really help you . the movie titles only said the x-files . the advertisements all seem to say the x-files : fight the future . well 
 i can't remember that i saw any blacks on the commuter train they use . these are the people who can count on their kids to live an even better life than themselves . perhaps this should also be a subject for a thesis in movie sociology ? 
 i can't remember the last time i had such a good time at the movies . i think sometimes you have to be able to watch a movie and just get drawn into it . the fact that stars hank and ryan are at the top of their game does not hurt either . in particular 
 i cannot believe that they didn't at least bring back the scene in which the lead human character ( in this case 
 i caught myself feeling surprised that such a banal movie could actually be off-the-cuff and entertaining . the most distasteful thought in the closet is how little people really care about political correctness but how diligent they are in pretending the opposite . office politics always reveal people at their most vile : there is something unquestionably disturbing and familiar in watching petty little personalities trapped in their small trivial lives as they entertain themselves with self-made gossip and lies . besides auteuil 
 i could not imagine you truly appreciating much of this drug-induced picture's entire ride ( 5 . 5/10 for all those sober dogs ) . note : i have not read thompson's book . having said that 
 i could play that if i had a pair of breasts . in that same exact movie 
" i could see it on the screen ! ! overdone . ) . i also didn't quite "" buy "" the ending of the movie "
" i could see many people not liking it because it takes "" one too many "" twists and turns "
 i could see the audience's disgust . . . one member even had to be awakened after the film ended . don't believe the previews that you see . . . this is definitely not a film for everyone . this is quite possibly one of the most adult-oriented films to come out in recent years . kids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex storyline . the plot is just as fluid as the heaven that ward presents to us . it goes back and forth in time 
 i could tell what was going through her mind 
 i couldn't help but be touched by a powerful and affecting soliloquy delivered masterfully by cecilia fong sing lee which truly packs an emotional wallop and 
 i decided to obtain and view the fan-subtitled version first . thus 
 i definitely recommend you try this one out . you'll laugh . . . you'll cry . . . . it's all there . 
 i did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun 
 i did have a surprisingly good time . that's because 
 i did like it and i was entertained . overall dvd rating- * * *  the special features 
 i did like it and i was entertained . reviewed april 5 
 i did not like the musical interludes of jonathan richman that ran through the entire picture . i found them quite useless 
 i did not read the novel by thomas hardy 
 i didn't mind malcolm mcdowell's voice-over narration at first 
 i didn't really think it was anything special . . . but after having seen more films like it 
 i didn't think either one of these films would be any good from first instincts . everyone loves surprises . u-571 looked like another action film using an actual war as an excuse to shoot torpedoes and bullets . this may be true 
" i didn't think of it as a musical . there is so much going on in "" moulin rouge "" that "" musical "" seems too small a term to cover it . "" moulin rouge "" is the kind of creation that sends critics scurrying off to the big tub o' adjectives in search of proper words to describe the experience . australian director baz luhrmann "
 i didn't think the first hour needed to be as long as it was 
 i didn't want it to stop . this is not a movie for those wanting to avoid loud noises 
 i dig . so what if they're distracting ; they're supposed to be ! the acting 
 i do appreciate some sense of closure . in the end 
 i do know that 
 i do know that this film does not disappoint . finally a movie gets released that is as good as the trailer makes it to be 
 i do need to point out at least one inconsistency . goldman 
" i do not process them . "" not that he has the foggiest about what a processor is . or even a typewriter . a notation in the bbc ledger shows us just two words about the man : "" fogey "" and "" cult . "" this nagged me throughout the movie . if giles has not a clue about life-at-large "
 i do reccomend it simply to see the amazing 
 i don't care how old you are - if you have the time 
 i don't even know if i will . what is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year . i probably won't see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while . director peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful 
 i don't even know why i went to see it in the first place . the previews were so annoying that i predicted this was going to be the worst film of the year 
 i don't know what we'll be using . but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody 
 i don't really know . oh 
 i don't see how you will be disappointed with this film . yes 
 i don't think i got that bad of a deal 
 i don't think i have seen an r-rated film show an erect one before ( it's not completely 
 i don't think it needs one : it works perfectly well as a study of tibetan buddhist culture and how communist china . scorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do 
" i don't think so . . . "" department . despite those minor complaints "
 i don't think the film itself asked them . it certainly didn't address them or try to answer them . i was particularly disappointed that the film didn't deal more with the trauma of learning one's life is a tv show . carrey's performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman's pain 
" i don't want it to exist . "" not only does it not make sense that he didn't want it to exist "
 i don't want to ruin all the surprises ! if there was a part of you that was hesitating seeing dante's peak merely because it was rumored to be a waste of time 
 i don't want to see it 
 i don’t have the ghostface costume or the director’s cut laserdisc 
 i doubt it will . for everyone who thought titanic's story was too simple and cliche 
 i doubt it's possible to gather everything with just one viewing . stoppard is a master of detail : you'll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film 
 i enjoyed a film despite the appearance of several major flaws . if the allure of the friday night lights propelled varsity blues past it's flaws 
 i enjoyed oscar and lucinda . storyline faults pale in the light of two such finely-realized characters . thematically 
 i especially appreciated michell's playful changing-of-the-seasons number . if only ( and this is a surprisinly minor gripe ) he had lopped off the egregious epilogue ; for a story that thrives on what we bring to it 
 i even found her laugh to be cute 
" i even liked the whole homage to boyz 'n the hood that singleton pulled off in the end ( he called this movie a "" companion piece "" to that film ) . a very solid follow-up to an ever greater original "
 i expected a bit more punch at the finish . the film doesn't necessarily demand your 90 minutes in a theater 
 i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was . washington's subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency . however 
 i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office . since seeing the film 
 i feel that dean has lost a lot of his coolness from our perspective as the years have grown by . the only ones who seem to still lionize him are those members of his generation . same goes for brando 
 i felt it could have gone one of two ways : either it could have developed the plot to the point where the human story became more irrelevant and therefore could be resolved with a mechanical flourish ( the way the dreadful a time to kill ended up ) 
 i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks . as much as i enjoyed them 
 i felt that the film had something important to say . on further examination 
" i figured that it was an easy way out of making a bad movie . how hard is it to make an extremely terrible film but claim it is actually a mockery of other bad movies . was this wes craven's remedy from making "" real "" bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn ? it just seemed cheap to me . then i actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes "
 i find this kind of thing totally unacceptable 
 i found american history x to be an extremely good film 
 i found it difficult to believe that he could really be so cherubic ( and indeed 
 i found it difficult to laugh at some of francie's darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick 
 i found it to be a well-paced 
 i found myself agreeing with the buzz 
 i found myself breathing sighs of relief as the outrageous derring-do from the chow i know and love appeared onscreen--sliding on floors 
 i found myself groping for its message at each turn of the plot . its ultimate effect is comparable to claude chabrol's la crmonie 
" i found myself impatiently wanting the movie to just get on with it . zemeckis does successfully create a creepy atmosphere ; there are plenty of scares in "" what lies beneath "" "
 i found that a lot of the funnier scenes had already been shown in the film's trailer . and of course 
 i found the movie made me just smile more often than outright guffaw . that said 
 i found this to be quite an enjoyable film . the acting is quite good 
" i give "" what planet are you from ? "" three and a half out of five stars . comments ? feel free to e-mail them to : johnbeachem@dependentfilms . net for past reviews "

 i give this film an 8 out of 10 . -- chris meadows aka | author 
 i grew to care more about the characters and their plight . the film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil . the massaging sequences were strangely erotic 
 i guess 
 i guess . exactly how much credit 
 i guess a movie with o one to really root for ( i guess we do root for our four pals a little ) leaves you in the end without too much invested . so we leave it like we left pulp fiction before it 
" i guess i can pussyfoot around the actual word all i want but the best way to describe this kind of movie is a "" mindfuck "" . if you feel like watching a movie that moves very slowly "
 i guess that's enough . oh 
 i guess the fact stays ; tbwp is highly original 
" i had a good time . "" alien : resurrection "" leaves off 200 years after the last one "
 i had realized that my fansubbed copy of this movie was going to be gathering a lot of dust . a brief summary of the most noticeable differences between the original and the dubbed versions : the opening and closing songs are in english 
 i happen to like that kind of thing . and besides 
 i have a lot in common with charlie baileygates . i consider myself 
 i have already seen it . and i like it ! wild things is a film noir of the 90s 
 i have been asking people if they have seen gattaca . lately 
 i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca . most people don't even realize that it is a film . despite this fact 
 i have decided to review a movie currently playing in theaters rather than an almost forgotten video collecting dust in the far corner of a rental outlet . this may become a trend as species 2 
 i have no idea where this guy came from ( an r&b singer and mtv vj

 i haven't even mentioned the plot elements : fires 
 i heard every song from the movie probably a hundred times . by the time i got back home 
 i held my breath in anticipation of this movie for quite some time . the replacement killers was designed to be chow's big u . s . debut vehicle

 i just can't get over how terribly smart this film is ! 
 i just don't happen to watch it . having said that 
" i just like her that's all . "" the show has many funny twists . in one "
" i kinda lost a bit of my interest . i was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of "" human beings as animals "" then i was about the end battle sequence "
 i knew i would eventually have to see it . but as my concession to myself before seeing a streamline dub ( an act which tends to make me come away feeling rather dirty ) 
 i knew i would probably like it . i am a junky when it comes to `90s science fiction 
 i know 
 i know . i'm supposed to be a film critic . i'm not supposed to love transparent and formula pictures like this . but darn it 
 i know most of you loved it

 i know that stallone is 50 years old now 
 i laughed harder than i had in quite some time . while i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it 
 i like her best when she's

 i noticed a much more subtle approach than the other two films . granted that there’s stabbin-a-plenty going on throughout 
 i noticed this stand with these _daylight_ movie posters on it . i had never heard of the movie 
 i noticed two things about the audience . the first was that anytime a character made a slant toward one of the homosexual characters 
 i overheard one man raving about how great yet disturbing it was ; i also heard one particularly offended woman say with disgust 
 i personally would like to see more . he's nice 
 i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions . the film ultimately shouldn't work 
 i promised myself i'd never see the movie . but promises are made to be broken 
 i quite enjoyed it . in fact 
 i really hope you enjoy it 
 i really wanted to kill this character with my bare hands . i was tempted to knock a half star off my rating simply because he was present . the other supporting characters 
 i recommened you get out right now and go see it . the movie starts off with the boys wondering what happened to their tv . they notice that it has been stolen and they vow to find it . this wind their way through america searching for dallas ( she is a woman ) . they look for her because as they are searching for the tv 
" i refuse to review "" what lies beneath "" on the basis of its trailer alone ( although i am rather appalled that zemeckis has actually condoned it because "
" i said "" dramatic element "" ) "
 i said that the film is a clever cop-out because it presents a bunch of little humans reacting to an ant-like existence . in concept 
 i saw a non-matinee showing of it 
 i saw none of this in evidence in our packed screening 
 i saw the little mermaid for the first time . it took me a few years to get over an aversion to this movie that was caused seven years ago 
 i say . ) so was it worth it 
 i sense 
 i shrugged 
 i still check out my motley crue 
 i still know what you did last summer . . . all of them center upon teenagers . john carpenter's vampires features an entirely adult cast . this doesn't necessarily mean the behavior of these characters 
 i still live with my momma ! ! ) and related to a lot of the events that went down in this flick ( oh yeah 
 i still mourn that show's cancellation . cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film 
 i still very much enjoyed it . so even if you don't win one of mcdonald's free tickets 
 i suggest you move further down the aisle 
 i suppose it is a little weird 
 i surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about it . niccol's film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter

 i tend to disagree . what were the alien films about ? and

 i think . placed in this mobster's shoes 
 i think . she finds the right note for each scene and holds it . and devito has never had such a humanistic role before 
 i think he and his co-writers deserve more credit than that . there's plenty of substance here 
 i think i'll be okay . to paraphrase james berardinelli 
 i think it worked . the plot is simple 
 i think most kids 
" i think only chasing amy had as many "" laugh-out-loud "" moments . i'm not saying that i was hysterically rolling on the floor while watching waiting for guffman "
 i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste . they're quite different from action movies as we know them in america . these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past 
 i think you do that wonderfully 
 i think your someone who thinks i'm a moron . beatrice : well 
 i thoroughly enjoyed the movie . and if the humdrum trailer for a bug's life is any indication 
 i thought i was going to be groaning over the release of disney's latest 
" i thought that "" waterworld "" was watchable . read the following with those particular grains of salt . ] it's the year 2013 and things have fallen apart . due to a world war in the late nineties "
 i thought this movie was actually pretty good . the visuals and cgi are astounding 
 i urge you to check this one out . 
 i urge you to see the movie and see for yourself . the wedding singer is the story of robby hart ( sandler ) 
 i urge you to watch it and decide for yourself . it's not brain food 
 i usually felt like i missed something . i learned from scorsese's casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story . no mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies . for example 
 i waited for him to shout 
" i wanted to see him kick back and come out of his "" suit "" persona . even when he loses it "
 i was a little let down by the remaining action sequences . and on a minor point 
 i was able to see an advance screening of a * very good * movie . the very fast-paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher 
 i was amazed at how much it crackled with wicked wit and fright and how much intensity was intact . you can now sign me up as president of the robert mitchum fan club . he plays the role with a controlled malice that induces unease every time he appears . he's like the senior class president with an evil streak . if i ever need to stay awake 
 i was certain it might have overcome its genre to set some new precedent in romantic comedy cheese . but no . in the end 
" i was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real ! i also have to "" give it up "" to all of the actors inside the costumes "
 i was constantly reminded of last year's masterpiece fight club . both films consist of a predominately male cast . both films follow young men as they illicitly fight the traditional system for their own desires . and both films are seen through the eyes of one narrator 
 i was disappointed in that what i believed to be the best action sequence - where sean is attempting to intercept castor at the airport - is the first sequence of the movie ! consequently 
 i was dismayed by how much of the first two-thirds of the film was spoiled by the trailer . the movie was obviously constructed with the assumption that the viewer was unaware haley joel osment's character could see dead people . otherwise 
 i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an upper-crust debutante . rather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess 
 i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good . i'm happy to say that there's something about mary is not one of those trailer let-downs . in fact 
 i was expecting the film to be like the rainmaker 
 i was glued to his performance and sympathized with his character as he molded and shaped himself into the person that he hoped to become one day . and everyone else 
 i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good - stupendously good - miraculously good . anything less and it'll be the biggest disappointment of the century . i didn't want the doomsaying prophecy to come true 
 i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie . and it does it quite well . the characters are all smart 
 i was left wondering how much more enthralled i would have been had so much not been revealed to me in the promotional material . a year later 
 i was merely pleased . one thing 
" i was not moved . not even reaching the "" touching "" level is the cosette-marius pairing . my only previous experience with les miserables is with the musical ( as i am sure many others' is ) "
 i was on the verge of tears . unfortunately 
 i was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader . but batfans need not worry becauseholy unconventional casting ! keaton delivers . he is convincing as the tormented millionaire 
 i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century's greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see . how much could you dress up the sets ? how many models and computer effects could you use ? how much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks ? oh 
 i was quite skeptical up to the moment when i put the dub into the vcr and pressed play . my skepticism began its immediate decline when the opening theme began playing . as this is a children's movie 
 i was really into this movie . then again 
" i was rooting for him . it was good to see hanks back doing what he does best : playing the affable everyman . "" you've got mail "" certainly won't be winning any awards "
 i was skeptical of totoro 
 i was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near its one-hour mark 
 i was still laughing thru the entire thing . the most fun character by far is the doctor 
 i was struck by what was missing in the movie . as grand as it looks and as historically accurate as it is 
 i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with . in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles 
 i was surprised at how good it was . don't get me wrong 
 i was surprised at how good the plot is . writer brian helgeland has created a terrific story 
 i was surprised at mel gibson's performance . he provided a fantastic performance . the previews of this film led me to believe it was an all-out action flick 
 i was surprised by this movie . to begin with 
 i was surprised to find that the subject of multiple personalities is not just used as ammunition for jokes 
 i was told that it was a spoof of horror movies . from the master of the horror himself 
 i was unable to hear what the actors were hearing due to an audience loud with throat- clearing and squeaky seats 
 i was very disappointed with the soundtrack . low and unspectacular . 
 i wasn't a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film 
 i wasn't exactly prepared for the ending which left me feeling empty . it turned me off slightly 
 i wasn't so blown away . it seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting . the second time 
" i wasn't sure exactly what it was . "" if you meet jesus at the bowling alley "
 i wasn't too enthused as i entered the theater for the big-screen debut of the minute clan . but i was in for a shock 
 i wasn't very interested in seeing this film 
 i watched chow evolve from this distant 
 i watched the totoro fansub one night and the totoro commercial dubbed release the next . even though totoro is touted as a children's movie ( and a very good children's movie it is 
 i went into this movie not expecting a whole lot out of shandling . i've never cared for his previous roles 
 i went to see this 1989 cartoon rather than the brand new one from fox . let no one say disney is losing its monopoly on the market . they still have hotels on boardwalk _and_ park place . believe it or not 
 i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic . another interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus . we're always able to tell where the characters are ( someone's home 
 i will not go into a general intro . wilde's homosexuality ( a crime under english law until the late 1960s ) 
 i will say that very few will be disappointed . the animation 
 i wish she had devoted a little more time to the luminous middle act 
 i won't spoil anything . i make a point to only talk about maybe five minutes of the film and then leave the lesser-known details to you . okay 
" i wonder ) of course the main draw here is the non-stop "" whiz-bang "" comedy "
 i wonder if he likes dragons for some reason ? you think ? ) 
 i wondered why drew barrymore was voicing our hero . she's not really a voice actor 
 i wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end . the historical value of this movie is quite high 
" i would compare the truman show to niccol's gattaca . both films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds . but neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas ; neither film "" clicked "" and became an instant classic . nevertheless "
 i would dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale . cameron actually built a scale model of the titanic in a water tank 
 i would have chosen his performance as the nazi in apt pupil for the nomination ) ; an understated 
 i would have enjoyed the film more ( and i definitely could have lived without the glaring product placement for a certain mc-ubiquitous company ) . regardless 
 i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise . but the level of terror 
 i would hope not 
 i would say that the screenplay is a little weak in a few spots . this may be due to the film's hurried production . but i tell you that nothing in the script is so bad as to detract from the better scenes . the greatest aspect of the screenplay is that the ideas behind the million man march and the reasons for going are expressed without directly involving the march itself . this makes those ideas much more powerful because it eliminates the inclusion of minister farrakhan 
 i would say that this is one picture that you will thoroughly enjoy on a multitude of colorful levels . if 
 i would say the movie was mediocre 
 i would still suggest seeing this movie 
 i would take up residence at my local multiplex . even more to this movie's credit is the fact that it is a sequel to the 1997 sleeper/cult hit austin powers : international man of mystery . the original came out of nowhere ; it was a low-budget 
 i'd almost recommend that the academy add a best supporting transvestite category . 
 i'd almost recommend the film . almost . but what i really liked about this film is despite the fact that it's a mess 
 i'd have had the rival gang trying to get to the cars before memphis and his crew 
 i'd like to say it's nice to have spike lee vindicate himself after doing something like girl 6 . get on the bus is easily the best film he has made since do the right thing with the exception of maybe malcolm x . spike does in this film what he does best--he presents issues that face society in an unbiased manner and lets the audience sort their feelings on their own . i love a film that engages my mind . the story is about a busload of black men that board in south central los angeles and drive across the country to the million man march in washington d . c . the film was funded by fifteen african-american men and shot in just 18 days . this is another example of expert filmmaking ( writing 
 i'd like to single out renfro's daring work . he isn't afraid to play someone largely unappealing and cold-hearted ; he strips his character of vanity 
 i'd rather not think about that . i always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint 
 i'd say . if you can never watch any film with such a premise 
 i'd say this is one of the top ten best films of the year . it's so close to perfection 
 i'd say this movie's worth its s$7 ticket . hey 
 i'd suggest you stay far away from this one . i give the movie three and a half out of five stars . 
 i'd wager to say that the fact that it's confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is . while oprah's performance is powerful and easily sympathetic ( and i'm dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february ) 
 i'd want to run and hide . the sex scenes would be handled as a farce

 i'm a big fan of will patton ( armageddon 
 i'm a doctor not a political advisor ! ' this `political struggle' of chow's king mongkut between british imperialism and the internal power struggles of his kingdom adds only a distraction to the film's main focus of the unrequited love people can hold for one another . when it attempts to give partial validation to the love of the king and anna by their uniting to overcome this `power struggle

 it . . . bait to lure out the hacker . humorous dialogue 
 it acquits itself honorably . there must have been good rapport between director and writer . brian gilbert 
 it actually contains tasteful bathroom humor -- thought that was an oxymoron in a kids' picture 
 it actually enhances the meaning behind the story . ethan hawke has developed into a handsome adult actor 
 it actually is surprising . it is not a film drained in patriotism 
 it again would be difficult 
 it all clicks . damon and affleck are ideal as millennia-old buddies ; their scenes together have a seemingly effortless 
 it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul . the excitement starts before the music even begins . a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer 
 it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels ( and i won't reveal the ending here 
 it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end . american pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenage-targeted fare this season . i must question the studio that releases a movie like this . the producers are aiming these films at the 15-24 crowd 
 it also has very little to do with the bard's tale 
 it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell ( don't worry . . . it's not as graphic as you might think ) . the heterosexual scenes are quite graphic 
 it also looks like it rests among the clouds . but what dreams may come goes a different route . it shows us a heaven that most of us have never seen before . chris' heaven is his memories brought to life . his thoughts can make anything real 
 it also stretches our credulity too much 
 it amazes me that we are still forced to endure such hamfisted efforts as this one . however 
 it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds . that's true of home alone 2 and i'd bet money that it's true of home alone 3 ( opening soon ) . but home alone actually has a lot going for it 
 it appears that the house is worthless but upon further examination of some blueprints they discover 
 it became the third-highest grossing animated movie ever . four years later 
 it becomes obvious that harry expresses his obsession through crime . by the film's end 
 it becomes patently obvious early on that this is a made-for-tv movie 
 it began to get monotonous . thankfully 
 it begins to take off . george clooney is an air force colonel with connections all over the world . he has a nice sarcastic wit and the rough edges that you expect from most clooney characters . nicole kidman is head of a white house team on weapons smuggling . there is the usual flirtatious banter between the two 
 it boils over . other plot elements are thrown in for good measure . wayland suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can

" it caught on big . "" sweet sweetback "" is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era "
 it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing . in the end 
 it certainly doesn't turn out that way . the film begins in a classroom 
 it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards . it's a welcome change to the dramatic genre 
 it chose a more subtle approach that was much 
" it comes closest to a socio-psychological comedy-drama . "" as good "" also stars jack nicholson "
 it comes up short 
 it could be argued that this is the single most important element of the movie . if you appreciate character studies 
 it could be this way or that way . the movie is highly stylized and extremely well-made . it gets most of it's power from the two leads : ashley judd and tommy lee jones both give excellent performances . the characters are well-realized and believable and we feel libby's pain when she cannot see her child for 6 years . even though a lot of critics didn't like the film 
 it could either stand to delve into each vignette a little deeper 
 it could happen . and 
 it could have become a great action film ( and i use the term loosely ) . the edge is pretty much a survival-of-the-fittest film . but taking scream's lead 
 it could really stand to lose twenty minutes or so to give it better pacing . curdled seems destined to be a nice cult film for miramax . it'll be interesting to see if it will appeal to mainstream audiences as well . 
 it could very well be for neither of those reasons . as you watch the full monty 
 it could've fallen into a drab 
 it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak 
 it develops a theme which is never overpowering but is always present . perhaps niccol is warning our race about the changes genetic tampering could bring . would our society become a bunch of soulless zombies ? maybe human nature is a result of mankind's flaws . if we get rid of flaws 
 it develops into something more potent . but oscar is uncertain of lucinda's affection 
 it did not invlove steaminess 
 it did work . but copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability 
 it does have a nice sense of adventure not found in many sci-fi movies anymore . but 
 it does have a tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject . as the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture . what had started off as a brilliant 
 it does make us care about most of them 
 it does not stop and luckily 
 it does not suffer from the frantic tempo or actors' hysterics and raucousness than can spoil many a comedy 
 it does seem best to quit while you’re ahead 
 it does work 
 it doesn't . the final montage of arthur's men battling each other is quite marvelous 
 it doesn't carry the grand 
 it doesn't destroy the goofy glee path it's been following and it still makes you feel good . sandler does a good job here 
 it doesn't feel constricted ; the expansive apartment setting is well-used to vary the background 
 it doesn't hurt that they have a masterful script to work with . stoppard 
 it doesn't just confuse him ; it causes john to go so far as to question the whole nature of reality in the dark city . to john 
 it doesn't set up its story in a black and white 
 it eschews the seriousness of most art house films with a romping good story . the secret of the film's success 
 it eventually becomes a contrived distraction from the far more engrossing misadventures of quinn and robin . and since the film spends most of its time with the castaways 
 it faltered . somehow 
 it feels good 
 it feels really out of place . but at least it's a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of . on the whole 
 it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way . it makes me wonder what 
 it fits the movie's tone and everything 
 it fits within the established subplot of a perceived siege by neighboring burma 
 it forces her to reevaluate her empty life . it'd be sad if she weren't such an annoying phony . the title 
 it gets really slow . i even looked at my watch a couple times 
 it gets some ooze on himself 
 it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession . the censors wouldn't allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the 
" it goes to show that even the immoral aren't immortal . in what way "" your friends and neighbors "" is supposed to work is open to interpretation . it definitely has a lot to say about the price that comes with infidelity "
 it had a bad luck to be released in the same year as star wars . although both films have a lot in common ( ground-breaking special effects 
 it had been a long time since i had gasped while watching a movie . forget the others and the deep end ( which veered toward strained dramatics ) 
 it had the feel of slapstick comedy . replace the sword with a chainsaw and you'd effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness . while entertaining and funny 
 it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made 
 it handles these scenes especially well 
 it has a killer of an ending too . 
 it has a surprising sense of humor and a big dose of heart 
 it has a very appealing new twist in its characters . paxton gives one of the better performances of his career as the straight and serious leader of the group ( a far cry from chet in wierd science ) . perhaps bridget fonda is miscast as his advice-giving wife 
 it has its moments 
 it has lost control over sethe 
 it has since grossed about twenty-two . unfortunately 
 it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so . species ii begins in the present day

 it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film . rather 
 it is not the reason for participation . it can be difficult to grasp the lyrics because they are only partially subtitled . this is unfortunate for outsiders who know little about gypsy life because it's impossible to guess at the inspiration for such emoting performances . at least the emotional expression of the singers provides an easily sympathetic intensity that evokes an understanding about how attached the music is to tradition . you can assume that for every major change in their culture

 it is over drew barrymore's performance . while she does light up the screen

 it is quite an impressive film in terms of its ability to be so cliche and cartoony and not make plausibility an issue . please visit chad'z movie page @ http : //members . aol . com/chadpolenz - over 180 new and old films reviewed in depth 
 it is revealed that they're both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport 
 it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the film . a bad point though : apollo 13 features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script . those who consider themselves `scientifically illiterate' might have a slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show . this is however 
 it is simply to maintain appearances 
 it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes . perhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more in-depth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences 
 it is terrific . i strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash . it is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place . the film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging : the trade federation 
 it is the child actor mackenzie vega who adds the most dimension to the picture as annie 
 it is the film's length . at 115 minutes 
 it is the first of the '90s disaster films to successfully marry the advanced film technology with emotions that ring true--a film that makes a genuine impact 
 it is the kind of trashy that isn't hard to watch . it's good trash 
 it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired . one stormy night during the summer of 1839 
 it is typical of a lot of recent movies in that it is really just a glorified made-for-tv movie 
 it is unclear as to if any of the men will make it out alive . time bandits is a fantastically made film that caters to the imagination of anyone . with a terrific soundtrack 
 it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films . one of the new characters is darth maul 
 it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park : bigger 
 it is what killed him : the memories of hollywood and war blending together to form a living nightmare . 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; sent via deja . com http : //www . deja . com/ share what you know . learn what you don't . 
 it isn't . it's well made 
 it isn't quite original 
 it just comes natural to him . the screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood 
 it just could have been so much more enjoyable and memorable ! 
 it just doesn't work well . first 
 it just might carry enough soft-hearted cheer to make a tired old married couple smile on christmas eve . 
 it kicks into an entirely more satisfying gear in its second half 
 it lives up to the test of time . it has the feel of a classic 
 it looks like a western . as the film opens 
" it made me realize how much this movie has inspired and been stolen from . coppola's 1992 "" bram stoker's dracula "" owes a great stylistic debt to murnau's masterpiece "
 it made me wish i had seen it with my father so i could have given him a hug ( okay okay 
 it makes me feel good . hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is . he is 
 it makes the fictional characters seem powerless by comparison . still 
" it makes the old snl skit "" fred gervan : male prostitute "" seem tame and this summer's hit film american pie seem like deep throat ( not the nixon informer ) . a police officer pulls down his pants numerous times and complains about his skinny member but no genitalia is ever shown and a pornographic film appears on television but only the sound is indicting . deuce's adventures are relatively innocuous beyond some spanking and condom use "
 it manages to achieve what the filmmakers set out to achieve . in order to somehow justify one elaborate action sequence after another 
 it manages to maintain its truthfulness while teetering between comedy and melodrama . floating life centers around a hong kong family's sense of dislocation and loss of identity after moving to australia in order to avoid the communist takeover of hong kong 
 it marks an entertaining and satisfying return of what was once one of hollywood's favourite genres . indeed 
 it marks tremendous growth of mr . tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding 
 it matters in all films to the point where viewers don't deserve to feel cheated . by the way 
 it may encourage some people to read the original text 
 it may not have done nearly as well . but don't get me wrong . . . i hope the film does do well . it's a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen . i doubt most of us could have thought of this place 
" it may only take a couple decades until the future "" gattaca "" presents becomes true . contrary to the misleading trailers "
 it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land 
 it must be noted that out of everyone 
 it must utilize everyone in the cast to their highest potential not just the stars . denzel washington is the only reason to see this film for his inspirational and very depressing tour de force performance . as rubin carter 
 it never drags - and his direction of the film is very effective 
 it normally gets buried . the second best thing about gattaca is the production design by jan roelfs . the orange glow of gattaca's scenes are impressive 
 it occurs to them that the year 1876 was the american centennial and they also discover that the house was built by a world renowned architect admired by the wealthy . one man offers the brothers a substantial amount for the dwelling and tells them that he has over 40 other houses designed by the same architect . they decline his offer because they feel they can get more by auctioning it off . embarking on a much needed renovation 
 it offers plenty to satisfy and will certainly amuse its targeted audience . 
 it perpetuates male ones . the mend o not develop beyond being cariacatures of the manipulative businessman 
 it plays too long for an action movie of this nature . about 10 or so minutes of scenes containing unnecessary plot details could have been shaved from the running time . also 
 it probably would have helped 
 it proves to be somewhat disappointing considering the talent involved in the film's production . soldier begins in the year 1996 
 it provides some much needed entertainment which gives us science fiction fanatics just what we want : a science fiction film with morals behind it . whatever happened to giving the audience a lesson while entertaining ? hopefully more writers and directors will learn from gattaca . . . and hopefully audiences will too . p . s . personal note to p . j . gladnick : how dare you call this film the worst film of the year . i can't even begin to image what film you do like . that frightens me beyond anything . reviewed by respect ( pun intended ) - respect@aros . net http : //www . aros . net/~respect/movies . html 
 it ran with the gimmick of three different endings . if you wanted to see all three 
 it really affected me emotionally . the story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one 
 it really is a shame when the alleged comedy fails to deliver . but weep not 
 it really shows us a whole new world we've never seen before 
 it reminded me of the bear 
 it revels in a wholesome 
 it ridiculed the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them 
 it seemed so out of context . in this film 
 it seems 
 it seems almost impossible to avoid interest in seeing the film . the movie is easily the most anticipated motion picture ever 
 it seems an eternity for the desk clerk to ring up the man's credit card 
 it seems at first 
 it seems more like a horror movie than anything else . the coens seem much more interested in the plot twists and the atmosphere of confusion and paranoia than they do in the characters 
 it seems that rap singers have been cast in place of actors in most cases . rapper dmx has been cast as a club manager 
 it seems that the real killer is offing our heroes in the order in which they bite it in the movie'either the actor portraying them 
 it seems that we're supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended . most notably 
 it seems timely to re-evaluate what 
" it sensibly ends . what kind of ending could "" american psycho "" really have had "
 it serves as a scathing indictment of the 1980s 
 it should be a remarkably well liked film . one thing seems clear 
 it should be obvious this film is to be taken lightly . i guess without blatant one-liners and home alone style slapstick 
 it should not be overlooked . this may be one of the first oscar contenders of the year 2000 . copyright  2000 shannon patrick sullivan . archived at http : //www . physics . mun . ca/~sps/movies/wonderboys . html 
 it shouldn't let you down in the slightest . and 
 it shows with sharp realism the perpetual insecurity of showbiz people 
 it slowly dawns on the three 
 it slows down quite a bit 
 it sounds ridiculous 
 it stands apart from other war dramas . newton thomas sigel's cinematography of the exteriors is overexposed and extremely grainy 
 it starts to falter . while i was watching the film 
 it still comes out on top ( it is the best medical carry on ) because of the above factors . a must-see carry on movie . 
 it still features most of the regulars of this genre . sid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit 
 it still feels like brightly lit fluff . the director 
 it still is worth a look . 
 it still makes for good drama 
 it still manages to be a crowd-pleaser . the stars do a great deal to enliven what is actually a sub-par romance . richard gere plays ike graham 
 it still manages to be mature . in it's own way . 
 it still only scratches the surface of his talent . his dour role erases all traces of his appealing sense of humor ; fuqua 
 it succumbs to the need to throw in one last 
" it sucks . "" i was forced to agree : the plot was an afterthought "
" it suggests to the unprepared public dire events rather than a verbal joke . i'll grant you though that it is a good mnemonic device . "" le mauvais gout mene au crime "" ( stendhal ) edwin jahiel's movie reviews are at http : //www . prairienet . org/ejahiel "
 it takes a bit of getting used to in the beginning . this is supposed to be the material they discovered in the woods where the 3 disappeared ; edited and put onto the screen for the benefit of our audiences . tbwp is simply smart . filmed to look as if it was really a stock-shoot by a bunch of students in search of the blair witch as a school project 
 it takes a tremendous leap of faith to cheer for these guys . it's even more difficult to accept those re-powering the federal government as the heroes . given the current climate of the country and the distrust of big government 
 it takes far too long to get there . brest's deliberately languid direction perfectly suits the occasionally sombre tone of the material 
 it takes one to know one . 
" it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film . the film opens with a ridiculous present day setting which contains a scene that jabs at "" the jerry springer show . "" the scene "
 it takes them dead-on . 
 it takes us right up the brink of emotion 
 it then will go * this * way . ) while i freely admit that i know less than nothing about the market ( knowledge check : prices up -- good ; prices down -- bad ; most of the time 
 it triggers something in tom's head . things begin to change around him ( blinking red lights let off a strange hum 
 it turns out 
 it turns out that mary has more than one suitor 
 it turns red and becomes incredibly hot . when he remarks about what he thinks is evil 
 it unfortunately does at times go overboard 
 it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters . at times 
 it was a bodacious trip back ( and done very well ) . sandler shows a new side to himself while maintaining all his original charm ( or is it anti-charm ? ) . while the wedding singer only deserves three stars due to artistic merit 
 it was about getting the money to save the orphanage . now 
 it was almost the opposite in a certain sense . gibson's character has an almost uncountable number of one-liners 
" it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future . most movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes . this action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day . jewison's determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate . "" in the heat of the night "" shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the 1960's . it displays this perfectly . however "
 it was difficult for me to become invested in francie's story because he is such an unsavory character 
 it was difficult to recall what about it entertained me . yet entertain me it did . go is light and frothy 
 it was found that she had 14 times the normal amount of insulin within her blood . claus von bulow is then accused of attempted murder by his stepson 
 it was given an r . but at least this new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like south park . it is sick 
 it was hard to accept the reality that one day such a film would be made 
 it was hard to tell what was what and who was who . it's a good thing scott stops this after the first twenty minutes or else gladiator would have been torture to watch . instead 
 it was in victorian days . 
 it was intended to bring bruce lee's skills and kung fu philosophy to the western audience . it succeeded 
 it was more like a business transaction 
 it was more than they expected too ) . also 
 it was perhaps the best way to go . to go for cheap laughs would have been to cheapen the characters 
 it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it ) . the script uses this effectively 
 it was reintroduced to theaters the same day fox's animated film anastasia was released . you know disney 
 it was so loud i couldn't make anything out . 
" it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of "" blockubuster "" philosophy . but in the mid 1970s "
 it was still being built when it was blown up ? kevin smith 
 it was the gloomy decade 
 it was the world's first glimpse into the world of cutesy julia movies . a fun 
 it was to be expected that the music would be translated into english 
 it wasn't financially successful ( a tawdry 55 million bucks ! ) . so back we are 
 it wildly succeeds due to mr . aronofsky's striking direction . it's a rarity that a film so completely immerses itself into a protagonist's warped perspective of his surrounding 
 it will be the revelation that brooke shields 
 it will likely impress you with its success at bringing to life the style and spirit of the batman comic books . thanks to its distinctive look 
 it works . 
 it works . you may now return to associating the disney name with plush toys . 
 it works as a straight action movie almost the entire time . the only lapse is an overlong boat chase in which bumbling redneck sheriff pepper ( whose brother is a sergeant ) is introduced as some kind of comic relief 
 it would be easy to snicker at deep impact 
 it would be this area . it's natural for a married couple to become bored with each other 
" it would control us completely . "" beloved "" moves along freely "
 it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens . okay 
" it would have been just a really clever good-not-great flick . "" a bug's life "" has a similar premise "
 it would have been the time that i could easily call the sign for melodramatic overload if it hadn't been handled in such a way . the key thing here is that it's not about her gradual death and slip into insanity but rather that it's about her tumultuous relationship with her sister 
 it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others . the three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film 
 it would have ended much differently . however 
 it would have helped if it were established early on in the film 
 it would have lowered itself into camp ; if it was good 
 it would seem that he has succeeded . landing on the surface of mars 
 it would seem that marshall is out of his depth 
" it wouldn't be nearly as interesting . "" eraserhead "" is allegedly a horror movie "
 it'd be extremely out-of-touch ) 
 it'd be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou's outrage to full feature-length 
 it'll be interesting to see what he tries next .

" it's an extended sequence that finds an african-american couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a sneak preview of "" stab "
 it's an intelligent film about love 
 it's an overwhelming delight . i could say a few bad things about the movie 
 it's apparent that events are occurring specifically to funnel the characters into a position where there is only one possible route . coincidence is a crucial plot device ; without it 
 it's as a janitor ( ernest borgnine plays his boss ! ) . but one day 
 it's as good as it gets . 
 it's asking a lot for the audience to get behind the film's nationalism . even with its numerous flaws 
 it's bearable considering the genre 
 it's been done before 
 it's better suited for the younger generation who want a little spice in their flicks 
 it's blaxploitation queen pam grier ( foxy brown has become jackie brown ) . in one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier's career 
 it's brought to us by one of the best known satire writing/directing teams . even if most people don't recognize the names behind the films 
 it's captivating simplicity and depth of academic focus make it entertaining as an alternative form of social commentary and the film does something rare . it only uses violence when necessary to make its intended points . 
 it's christopher lloyd who really makes the movie special . lloyd gives yet another outstanding comic performance . his body language ( for example 
 it's clear there's some kind of powerful conspiracy going on 
 it's clear this film isn't going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling . considering how good it is up until that point 
 it's comforting to know that in mankind's final moments on the planet 
 it's complete funhouse of a movie . director stephen sommers is much better when it comes to adventure ( the jungle book ) than horror ( deep rising ) 
 it's damn fun . sure it's predictable . but so ? a lot of movies are - you knew that john mcclane was going to kick terrorist ass in every die hard movie right ? it's all of matter of how you get to that point . so yeah 
 it's definitely worth the visit . 
 it's done in the name of the greater good 
 it's downright refreshing to sit through an innocent picture like this and laugh without feeling guilty . 
 it's easy to become mesmerized with the culture . a nice added touch is that men take as much pride as women in being able to evoke physical grace . and though the dancing does have a sexually alluring quality

 it's just a comedy that we don't feel bad about watching . sure it may come off as offensive and may come off as dumb sometimes 
 it's just a day job . there's a hilarious locker room scene where they debate whether decapitated heads can talk 
 it's just another miserable day on the job . most of the characters that are revisited by the screenplay revolve in some way around mary ( patricia arquette ) 
 it's just lovely . i have to admit i was half-expecting farting armpit humor 
 it's just plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they can capture a person's life without the person realizing it -- how they coordinate extras 
 it's just something that they must go through in order to get big pay cheques . at the heart of the movie's narrative are scenes showing pitch action from a first-hand point of view . if sometimes they seem irrelevant or confusing -- well 
 it's just that it's been done before ; and better 
 it's just that the ending doesn't quite have the emotional punch that the other film's did . plus 
" it's kind of grown on me . ) "" drunken master "" 's storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies "
 it's likely that you'll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love . joseph fiennes

 it's m . tomei with a bullet . happy accidents is a romantic comedy filtered through twelve monkeys ( or 
" it's merely a blip ( no "" annie hall "" but it's no "" shadows and fog "" either ) "
 it's never actually boring and it's always intriguing . watching the government set-up smith is endlessly fascinating 
 it's never less than wildly entertaining and insightful . though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one-man show -- a typical afternoon in the life of blake 
 it's never quite answered . maybe series fans know more on this subject . though really 
 it's nice to see a film that embraces softened sensuality other than explicit sexuality . perhaps that renovated release date 
" it's nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do : send us out with a smile . it's a fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing "" toy story 2 . "" it's the rare sequel that manages to expand on "
" it's no "" toy story . "" that film "
 it's no phantom menace beater 
 it's not _that_ type of movie ) 
 it's not a baseball movie . although the film is extremely spiritual 
 it's not a tearjerker . to really understand what field of dreams is all about 
 it's not about religion . and although field of dreams is melodramatic 
 it's not all action- there's a message here as well that has to do with family . this is easily one of disney's best animated films of the decade and it's one i can't wait to put in my home library . . . that is 
 it's not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope . a serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia 
 it's not as recognizably so . it's a spoof so subtle that many won't recognize the spoofery . if you deem this as sci-fi/action 
 it's not bad at all 
 it's not clear . clearly though 
 it's not enough that just one or two chickens escape -- she wants everyone to be free of the tweedys . then one day 
 it's not entirely necessary to re-introduce your characters with each episode . this is why i believe non-fans have a hard time getting into star trek ; in order to enjoy it 
 it's not even close . janeane garofalo is not only the queen of the romantic comedy 
 it's not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring

" it's not good to know too much about someone , charlie ,  charles warns his niece "

 it's not just about sex . color can appear as a result of love 
 it's not likely . dante's peak is cliched 
 it's not out of the question that he had some input into this scene . ) director gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy 
 it's not really her fault ; her part is under-written 
 it's not roll in the aisle funny 
 it's not surprising that we're rooting for him to get what he wants . but for me 
" it's not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is : it's him . "" celebrity "" is "
 it's not the full story 
 it's not very good 
 it's not very original in plot ( just take luc besson's own la femme nikita and mix in plenty of his own the professional et voila ! ) 
 it's occasionally difficult to distinguish between the two . distinguishing between the two stories isn't a problem in the scenes containing paltrow 
" it's off to war i go . . . "" ) "
 it's often hard to understand why finn would appreciate her beyond a physical level ( but 
 it's one hell of a downer 
 it's one of the best films this year : it's smart 
 it's one of the year's best feel-good movies -- 91 minutes of unrestrained joy that no one should miss . 
 it's only expected that the material gets a little drawn out and repetitive 
 it's perhaps the most tender scene of the year . tenderness ? in a quentin tarantino film ? sure 
 it's petty to quibble . its penchant for parody is irresistible 
" it's played as a tongue-in-cheek piece of black comedy instead of a serious contest of strength . "" dangan runner "" takes three people whose lives have bottomed out and intertwines them in bizarre ways . tomoroh taguchi ( the quintessential japanese cult actor ) "
 it's possible that the subject matter was too hip or trendy to attract any real audience . now 
 it's pretty fun . i remember seeing these turtle flicks before . this would be the good one . a nice 
 it's pretty obvious where it's heading--but these are minor complaints . redford and thomas are strong and convincing as the couple drawn by a mutual affection for the great outdoors and each other 
 it's probably more than a little surprising to you that i'm rating this particular streamline dub so highly . i know it's damn * surprising to me . you see 
 it's quite an awesome spectacle 
 it's quite fresh and original . it's a character study more than anything 
 it's really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story . the first film 
 it's really impossible to compare them . they both go for different things 
" it's really like no live-action film i have ever seen . the film is not without its faults . some of the scenes and ideas are "" borrowed "" a little too liberally from other films "
 it's really putting a modern twist on what we have seen over and over again . the setting is perfect 
 it's really quite a film 
 it's really something to see . . . and it's often as funny as anything 
 it's really true . he and ralph macchio must hang out or something . maybe they live in dick clark's pool house . anyway 
 it's sad and regretful 
 it's shallow 
 it's since gone on to capture acclaim at the 1998 sundance film festival ) 
 it's sincere 
 it's slightly confusing . also 
 it's slow . once hanks knows the secret 
 it's sly stallone to the rescue . and rescue he does 
 it's startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulan's land . at its core 
 it's still a smart and insightful film . though some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced ( some seem too cartoonish 
 it's still definitely worth checking out . 
 it's still often an enjoyable 
 it's such a shame that his latest crime caper 
 it's surprising how light and easy blessed art thou feels . depending upon your point-of-view 
 it's that it tries to take a moral stance when it's not very appropriate to do so . i don't think it's that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba'ku in order to save the lives of thousands . better yet 
 it's that the villians aren't quite clearly explained enough . we understand their motives 
 it's the firemen who run into the burning building while everyone else is running out ! and stephen himself tells his younger brother 
 it's the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go 
 it's the other major strength of the movie 
 it's the perfect blend of the feel-good '60s nostalgia of stand by me ( also by king ) and mystical power hokum of mile . king's atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories 
 it's the rules and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy . yet somehow 
 it's the way it processes the action sequences by going over the top and not apologizing for it 
 it's to trust no one . thus 
 it's totally enjoyable . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . movie views by jamey hughton : http : //welcome . to/movieviews

 its budget is a lot more money than i'll ever see in my lifetime .  and there's not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money .  in fact 
 its central theme offers an opportunity to ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe -- all while having a good time .

" most of the "" bad guys "" are fellow democrats on the same road to the white house . rather than issues "
 most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen . but despite anything 
 most of the basic facts are in order . several 
 most of the character's motivations and thoughts are pretty obvious from the beginning . most non-knotts dialouge is boring and weak . plus 
 most of the characters in cookie's fortune are loads of fun to observe 
 most of the film is boring and needs something interesting to be put on the screen and the story was told harsher than it needs to be . still 
 most of the film's characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions . none seem very affected by their experiences 
" most of the kung fu and other "" martial arts "" flicks were cheap "
 most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos . the real draw here is christian bale and his over-the-top performance as patrick bateman . whenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters . i always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman

 most of these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne and his screenwriter 
 most of these events take place off-screen . his decision to not over-explain rituals is commendable . the stumbling oracle who spits out his prophecies while in a trance state is much more effective as a mystery than if we were spoon-fed interpretations . philip glass's score is impressive although at times it is too overwhelming and distracting . i talked to a tibetan i met outside the theater who had just seen the film and was walking back in to see it again . hearing his description of how he escaped from tibet at the age of seven and how his father was one of the soldiers accompanying the dalai lama during his trip to india

 much of notting hill's strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis . a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he's even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey-soaked apricots from his refrigerator . or take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image . william assures her he wouldn't say a word

 perhaps 
 perhaps because they are so close to it 
 perhaps caught up in his reverence for the man 
 perhaps europe's greatest classical music conductor . when other artists fled germany 
 perhaps even boring . but there are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough to recommend it . the pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest . before the audience can get tired of one location 
 perhaps even more so . this is the chow yun-fat that hong kong cinema has been in love with for nearly twenty years . he is imposing 
 perhaps even of literature . but all are hugely impressed by having an english author in their midst . dull 
 perhaps for some of the same reasons . but at least on a high level they are much the same story . the other problem with the timing of heist is that it involves airport security and clever ways to get around them . i saw the film at the toronto international film festival on september 12 
 perhaps for some sort of confirmation . sometimes he picked right the first time 
 perhaps he can never come to the truth . in large part the film is about mind games that arnold uses to manipulate his interviewees and especially furtwangler . where the script has problems is that in the end it is so ambiguous . it has no obvious resolution and not much of a final act . when it is over whether anything has been established is open to interpretation . perhaps that is better than so many films that make it all to obvious what the audience should believe 
 perhaps his ( and 
 perhaps in homage to d . w . griffith . cinematographer ernest dickerson 
 perhaps it was to him as well . these two points don't detract greatly from the film . the people vs . larry flynt is certainly among the very best studio-released films of 1996 
 perhaps more by hunch than actual scientific proof

 perhaps one of the reasons is that i need to see it a few more times before its full force really sinks in . the movie is like a walk through a long maze of rooms 
 perhaps purely thematically . for the former 
 perhaps so many they qualify as dialogue . and it could have used a sharper script 
 perhaps that's the point . the distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start 
 perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne ( although 
 perhaps the best sequence : a romp with hot-as-hell teen idol 
 perhaps the most important word in the english language . in redford's terms happiness belongs to those who have found it . scarlett johansson provides us with a believable performance of a fun-loving girl who 
 perhaps the most normal of any of the characters 
 perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film's charming cast and tricky plot 
 perhaps the year's most inspired casting )

 several government officials were found spying for the soviet union . a very good film was made of this . it starred rupert everett . the script was by mitchell . for the current movie --the third about wilde-- mitchell based his scenario on the admirable biography by richard ellmann . the great scholar and critic finished this long labor of love as he was dying of lou gehrig' s disease . he died in march 1987 . the book appeared in early 1988 . there is no way for a film script to reconstruct a 680-page volume . the scenario wisely opted for selective choices and inspirations . it is faithful to ellmann's belief that wilde was as original and major a writer

 shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business . tenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento's scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here . it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play . in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes . needless to say for argento fans

 shakespeare in love is not a movie that takes itself seriously . ( will shakespeare of the 1590's would've been married to anne hathaway

 so after telling us for 60 + minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece 
" so any such discussion will by its very nature come across as a load of gobbledegook . good movies like "" back to the future "" ignore the subject altogether "
 so chipperly depraved one can't help but turn off his moral judgment for its duration and enjoy the ride . in that sense 
 so did his passion in life . as played brilliantly by ian mckellen 
 so do differences . director malick has a story to tell 
 so does our comprehension of their world . as a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker 
 so don't expect any connelly hits in the chart's any time soon . william hurt is not bad 
 so enright tells stempel that he is going to give the wrong answer 
 so far at least 
 so have high expectations . pros : animation and sound are a feast for the senses 
 so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy . realizing he can't just keep the giant in a barn all the time 
 so he opts for a more genial 
 so he packs some clothes and leaves 
 so he seeks employment as a busboy . he quickly becomes friends with greg ( breckin meyer ) and anita ( salma hayek ) 
 so he's also heading over there . . the comparison to pulp fiction earlier on was not accidental - quentin tarantino executive-produced this film 
 so he's on his own quest to stop olive and company . as with any good simpsons episode 
 so his critique of the film should be appreciated on that level . this movie relies heavily on style and peculiar humour 
 so hurry up 
 so i guess she did her job okay . but in the end 
 so i stopped by to check it out . it turned out that they were giving away free passes to the movie for people who had or applied for the credit card they were offering . so 
 so i was 
 so i won't . it's enough to say that it tests the faith of every member of the small order 
 so i wonder if i'll be doing the same thing on january 1 
 so i would say the show is fine for kids five and up 
 so i wouldn't recommend parents taking the youngsters to it . 
" so i'll qualify it by adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of "" science fiction "
 so i'm told 
 so if you blink 
 so imagine what it would be like for neo . and who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves ? reeves 
 so instead i will avoid it entirely . the first two-thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along 
 so is batman returns ( 1992 ) to batman ( 1989 ) . what does that mean ? that means it's a worthy 
 so is damon 
 so is portillo - he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer 
 so is she like the queen ? 
 so it comes as a shock when we see him gibbering and waving his fingers around like squid's tentacles and motormouthing his way through the opening credits about everything from what they put into the water to who killed jfk . he's a nut . he's also a nut with a case of puppy-dog erotomania 
 so it gets * * * stars . 
 so it isn't that good . george dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting 
" so it's funny to us . another thing that helps "" chicken run "" ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing . there are references to "" the great escape "
 so it's not all good . it's while doing time in a florida prison that clooney learns of one rich inmate's ( albert brooks in a frightful bald wig ) collection of diamonds in detroit . clooney and cohort ving rhames plan the score 
 so it's not entirely new 
 so it's not really all that new a story 
" so it's not so hard to guess that "" existenz "" is a violent and gory film . besides the regular murders of innocent people "
 so just see the film and listen to it . it's wonderfully composed and presented . and be sure to stick around during the closing credits ! mcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use ( while most comedies use it for outtakes ) . he has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events . some may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot 
 so kubrick decided to play it as comedy 
 so leave the kids at home for this one . . . ; ) where's joblo coming from ? american psycho ( 10/10 ) - a clockwork orange ( 9/10 ) - donnie brasco ( 8/10 ) - fight club ( 10/10 ) - get carter ( 7/10 ) - godfather ( 10/10 ) - godfather ii ( 10/10 ) - goodfellas ( 10/10 ) - lock 
 so many sights . a betrayal 
 so much of my expectation was happily for naught . in a couple of places 
 so much so 
 so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all . for the often-criticized reeves 
 so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is . cheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her . she works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film 
 so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job ( for none other than phillotson at the local school ) 
 so of course that's just another good point ) . and since they've had to time to develop the roles 
 so on the one hand she's trying to match him up with someone who will make him happy 
 so one can't complain about the amateurish quality . what you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny 
 so perhaps they are a different related species . not only are they more intelligent than in the past films 
 so put the guilt behind 
 so quaint 
 so scary 
 so sexy and smart . they meet 
 so she goes upstairs to find cookie dead 
 so she reluctantly hires quinn to fly her there . the plane crashes during a terrible storm 
 so she tries to pass off cookie's suicide as a murder . she goes through all the steps trying to make it seem like a murder 
 so some of notting hill's finest moments revolve around william's eccentric friends and family . by now 
 so take my recommendation as you will : for me 
" so that all the aged drown and only physically fit younger people survive . thus did iku terminate progress-impeding immortality . all this is far more poetic than the american "" time for a change "
 so that claire's affair is automatically justified . norris is so effective as john that he makes andreas and claire's love difficult to accept . we feel for him . he's a decent man . sure 
 so that he can meet them 
 so that i could get home at a reasonable hour . the other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated . e-mail ? when my kids are my age 
" so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections . it's like "" la dolce vita "" without the accuracy "
 so that none of those movies became one-dimensional . newman's latest film 
 so that wasn't so bad . i did however enjoy director duguay's interesting style and cinematic vision . this thriller could easily have been boring during many sequences 
 so that when there's very little of them 
 so the cell stays open and he plays scrabble with the sheriff and the faithful emma ) . meanwhile 
 so the entire sequence -- which occupies most of the first half of the movie -- feels exactly like the elaborate red herring that it is . as a result 
 so the film is never quite sure where it's going . in the end however 
 so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport . in a surprisingly plausible setup 
" so the older cop teaches him about the way things work in the "" real world "" . how even cops like themselves have to "" bend the rules "" and "" break the law "" every now and then "
 so there is more to look forward to ! 
 so they return to the colony with flick and find themselves in an unusual position . the most obvious element of a bug's life is the quality of animation . created by pixar 
 so this review is obviously a tad biased ( at least i admitted it ) . of course 
 so to get me laughing out loud 
 so to speak 
 so to speak . incidentally 
 so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived . however 
 so we're essentially stuck with empty gestures . when he tries to offer some sense of togetherness ( no pun intended ) like a soccer game or a crowded dinner table 
 so weird and twisted that it is hard not to look at him 
 so when a crazed drunk is out on his boat and sees what he calls a metal monster the townspeople joke around with him at first . when cars start getting eaten 
" so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit hand-in-hand ( "" manhattan "" really is one of the best-looking films i've ever seen "
 so when she goes up there to inform them of it 
 so when someone else wants to make a little money 
 so who am i to talk . the one thing that did blow my mind was the actual physical transformation endured by actor benicio del toro for his role as dr . gonzo . i couldn't believe that this fat 
 so why do they do it ? there are moments of brilliance 
 so why not show scenes where she wonders about her future without virgil ? now that he's with amy 
 so you'll have lots to laugh at . if not 
 soaked look . if it isn't night-time 
 sober scenes are astounding sequences where the camera submerges in neon light 
 socially conscious 
 society lion and 
 soft british voice and gentle look 
 soft eyes 
 softly punctuating the blank spaces . it's a near perfect blend of styles 
 sold 
 soldier 
 soldier combines science fiction with the western and the action movie 
 soldier contains many graphic scenes of violence which may be inappropriate for children . although 
 soldier doesn't pull any punches [no pun intended] when it comes to violence -- one of the reasons i suspect event horizon was so squarely criticized . soldier is violent ; it has many bloody scenes 
 soldier has the ingredients to make a superior film . it is written by david webb peoples 
 soledad st . hilaire

 something happens . someone gets sick . then another . then another . soon 
 something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs . alec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen ( it sure is better from his fair game ) . baldwin can be a good or a bad character 
 something he wants to avoid even if he does sleep around with tons of other women . it's obvious that robby is going to fall for julia and feel a strong need to rescue her 
 something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night . osment is phenomenal 
 something is fishy 
 something is so ridiculously implausible that you have to groan ) . maximum risk basically serves as a vehicle for martial arts star jean-claude van damme 
 something many of his peers wouldn't do . ( can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor-thomas in the same role ? ) renfro was recently charged with possession of cocaine-i hope he doesn't continue down that path 
 something missing from it 
 something much harder than mere stumbling about . but the academy of arts and sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons . if you don't believe me 
 something that is a credit to his history as a screenwriter . he's also assembled a very capable cast 
 something that is also implied by the anglo-saxon name of dictator simms . but 
 something that will destroy us but that we can't live without . these ideas are all worked into this film nicely

 sometimes boring sequences not edited down to size

 sometimes eliciting an odd chuckle from the audience . and the depth of his dramatic range is only hinted at in the silent

 sometimes expectations can be shattered . a lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far 
 sometimes i find 19th century british costume dramas a little hard to relate to . it's not the time or the distance 
 sometimes in most unusual circumstances - like with secret service agents 
 sometimes it leaves the recognition entirely up to the public . mop is remarkably low-key 
 sometimes it's a passing mention

 special effects and underwater cinematography are all outstanding . and so they should be : cameron's technical credentials are well established . but what ultimately makes the film so gripping is three intersecting plot strands : 1 ) the tension between old sparring partners lindsay and ex-hubby bud ; 2 ) the war of wills between the civilian crew and the navy divers as a series of escalating crisis' befall them ; and 3 ) the slowly unfolding revelation of what lies at the bottom of the three mile deep abyss . the abyss : special edition is an improvement on the original film in two major respects . one is that it further fleshes out the relationship between bud and lindsay

 tarantino fixes this by moving onto the climax of the film 
 tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort 
 tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a '70s icon . this time around 
 tarantino returns to what made his name a household one : directing and writing . jackie brown is the result 
 tarantino uses a '70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits . there are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre ( although grier never does any butt-kicking ) . grier is jackie brown

 the acting 
 the acting is pretty mediocre . let's just call it corny . ( why 
 the acting is terrific 
 the acting was good 
 the acting was hopeless 
 the action is cartoonish enough to seem too unreal to be sensitive to . even if one were to excuse a number of faults due to its being an action movie 
 the action lacks the intensity and ferocity of spielberg's recreation of the fury of warfare . it also seems to lack that gritty air of authenticity that seemed to effectively suck audiences into the maelstrom . the combat scenes give the audience the extremes of heroism . but malick is also concerned with showing the madness of battle fatigue 
 the actor makes him sympathetic and endearing . while keaton

 the actors were good and manage to bring multidimensionality to their simple roles . richard dreyfuss is very convincing as a ordinary 
" the actual "" talkie "" scenes almost become too much of a distraction from the rich portrayal of the community . in vengo "

 the attacker runs off . the dazed man gets out of the tub and finds a woman's body in the room . a mysterious caller warns him to leave the apartment immediately

 the audience expects a confrontation . in fact 
 the audience finds out 
 the audience gets to see john travolta acting like the wild nicholas cage we've come to love 
" the audience is as confused as the characters : detached from their everyday existence and no longer able to see the difference between the real world and the alternative reality that they have created . "" the matrix "" "
 the audience is keenly aware of the major flaw in the movie : nothing is ever really explained . soldier never details ( a ) who todd fights for 
 the audience laughed hysterically . the scenes were obviously written to be funny 
 the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law . from an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner 
 the audience sees todd grow to adulthood and some of the campaigns on other worlds that he is involved in . already 
 the audiences can enjoy an autopsy of a two-headed mutated amfibium . scenes like that have become a trademark for cronenberg and it seems that he can't make a film without flowing blood and foul creatures . the way i see it 
 the aural landscape is as engaging as the visual energy permeating the film . good and bad vibrations tangle like the conflicting desires and values of the message . every once in a while 
" the australian/belgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable . the romance gets started when former musician andreas ( charles "" bud "" tingwell ) "

 the black and white images don't saturate the senses the way they do in a theater . there's also the most creative use of sound in almost any movie i've ever seen : not a single scene in the film is silent . there's always something rumbling

 the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama's spirit and the future leader of a nation . it is a great weight to put on the mind of a child . in the u . s . it might be grounds for a call to social services . but the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage . neither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable

 the british actor consistently maintains a serviceable southern drawl 
 the brothers are forced to talk about * that * and maybe get into a fight . as the movie approaches its inevitable end 
 the brothers find there is a slight problem which may lower the property value of their house ; a mouse ! they feel that the problem could be more than one mouse but it turns out from the audience's look at the film that there is indeed only one mouse who feels the two brothers are the invaders and not him . the mouse is extremely clever as he avoids traps and leads the brothers into creating more destruction for themselves in their attempt to catch him . the mouse steals an entire block of round cheese by rolling it like a wheel . he has the brothers fall victim to their multiple mouse traps and he even outsmarts an expert exterminator ( christopher walken ) in a key role approaching it like he was a bounty hunter . 'mouse hunt' is a good family film addressing the necessary comic turns comparable to the dark punch of a boxing glove and lee evans is hilarious as the better of the two brothers named smuntz . sounds like a name perfect for comedy . the interesting thing about the movie is that the scenes with the rodent rascal are done three ways . with a real mouse 
 the brothers have to talk about how * that * affected their relationships . all of this makes for a lot of repetition ( the story about why burns broke up with diaz is brought up at least eight times )

" the campbells' precocious daughter . the only really funny or heartwarming moments in the film revolve around annie's frank ( but misguided ) understanding that cage is not her real father but an alien come to observe our planet . never has the phrase "" welcome to earth "" drawn such touching laughter from an audience .

 the cast steals the film 
 the casting for this film is great . tobey maguire and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood . they play their roles as the parker brother and sister perfectly . with a plot as unbelievable as this film 
 the casting of harrison ford in the broadly comedic lead role plays a sizeable part in the movie's success ; ford is such a concentrated dramatic actor that it's easy to forget what a funny guy he can be . as his female counterpart 
 the castmembers are basically just vehicles for the jokes . there aren't characters here 
 the center of tv's world 
 the change is dramatic . baker's once adonis-like looks are wizened -- wrinkled creases of skin abound ; aged 
 the chans initially find this serene new land a strange and wonderous one 
 the characters all came across as people like you and me with issues and struggles and hopes and fears . i liked this movie a lot because it was masterfully written 
 the characters are forced into a half-hearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing . but at one point 
 the characters are very 
 the characters are very underwritten . we know nothing about dr . marrow 
 the characters become more cartoonish-barlow's post-torture revelry felt phony 
 the characters do little more than sing and slightly sway to the music ; here 
" the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well . everything from "" friends "" and "" saved by the bell "" to "" showgirls "" and "" terminator 2 "" is referenced here ; horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning "
 the characters lose all sensibility . i have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water . why not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across ? i guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while . thankfully

 the chip falls into the innocent hands of a little boy ( alex d . linz ) who doesn't know what he has until late in the movie . four criminals working to smuggle the chip to the eventual buyer trace its whereabouts to linz's neighbourhood and come in direct contact with his house and the attempted recovery of the chip is under way . naturally 
 the cinematic output from its creator 
 the cinematography and effects are outstanding . arrow video's digitally remastered version of the classic is something of a mixed-coffin . the cover art features a red-tinted 
 the cinematography in this film is nothing special 
" the cinematography is crisp and rich . the story will keep you on the edge of your seat . nothing is what it seems . [this appeared in the 4/11/96 "" bloomington voice "" "
 the citizens of the famous mountainside town are celebrating life's good fortune . the birds are chirping 
 the city is not on earth at all . and the reason why john doesn't fall victim to the nightly suspended animation 
 the city under siege 
 the climax comes forty-five minutes before the end of the movie ; it goes without saying that the movie drags on the back end . the thin red line will doubtless be compared to 1998's other masterpiece of war 
 the closet flirts with being politically correct and is as predictable as it only can be . what gives the film a tint of pleasure and saves it from being totally grotesque and improbable is that the movie never aspires to be anything more than what it is . director francis veber ( the dinner game ) finds a delightful irony in the fact that pignon has to lie that he doesn't like women in order to prove he is a man . we 
 the coen brothers' last film 
" the coens also aren't quite immune to horror cliches ; they indulge in a prolonged dead-guy-seems-to-have-come-back-to-life-but-then-we-find-out-it's-only-a-dream scene that had me rolling my eyes . the film also ends so quickly after the final confrontation that i found myself wondering if they had simply run out of film . "" blood simple "" is not quite the masterpiece of neo-noir that many seem to think it is "
 the coens had the world to play with as a palette . what they delivered is a wreck . the story 
 the colourful array of supporting characters -- into the mix where it goes slightly awry . off to battle 
 the combination works even better . the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique . try to imagine a toned-downed version of travis bickle who

 the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style . now

 the editing of the film is good . the pacing is on track 
 the editing plays around with cutting and speed 
 the effect is mildly jarring and

 the ending of good will hunting is completely predictable . but meeting expectations and following a familiar path aren't always bad things in a movie 
 the energy and the patience 
 the entire cast works wondrously together 
 the entire film from beginning to end is a non-stop adventure . the ending of the film 
 the entire film would fall flat because so much of it is reliant on the audience feeling rick's pain and frustration . the supporting actors also put in fine performances 
 the entire man-hunting bear plot . this has been done many times in films with different animals

 the film 
 the film almost acquires a tragic tinge . it is an osca-caliber performance . billy crystal's supercharged acting is striking too 
 the film also has a tendancy to drag at times . the ending goes on for far too long 
 the film as a whole plays fast and loose with reality and logic . police procedure is totally ignored and it's almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or could proceed in this manner . but the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction 
 the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time 
" the film becomes more interesting . the speed in "" the green mile "" is perfect . if time was a matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark "
 the film begins to grow on the viewer more and more . after a few failed escape attempts during their lifetime 
 the film begins when we see john murdoch ( sewell ) wake up with no memory . he can't remember his wife emma ( connely ) or the murders that he has been framed for . and when he encounters strange 
 the film chronicles the forays of 3 students who go in search for the legendary blair witch . audiences are put in the first-person perspective in the entire mis-adventure 
 the film comes up short primarily because lee does not allow the audience to get involved with the characters until the last half-hour of the film . lee's obsession with technical gadgetry in this film represents a disturbing trend in his work . where in earlier films like do the right thing and malcolm x 
 the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who single-handedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north . she manages to resurrect the family plantation 
 the film could have easily slumped into a routine action/thriller . a great deal of the credit for the film's success can be given to the actors 
 the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time . sure 
 the film does a good job of examining the inner rage that overcame the woman and her actions thereafter . if your looking for a cool 60s noir piece 
 the film does have its compensations . it looks fabulous 
 the film does start a little slow ( and go a little long ) 
 the film does veer occasionally into some rather lowbrow humor 
" the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; "" chicken run "" feels fresh "
 the film doesn't require a lot of thought 
 the film fails to provide a political overview of the war as it progresses ( the dillane characters reports an american plane departing from sarajevo as it departs 
 the film features some great old songs on the soundtrack 
 the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time . we can turn off our brains 
 the film forces her to fall in love with him . also 
 the film gets its momentum and its thrills from the use of the tricks of the movie trade 
 the film gets overly theatrical . yet 
 the film goes through many 
 the film harkens back to the 1970s 
 the film has already run about a third of its course . his is an interesting character . made out to be some kind of negotiating superman 
 the film has plenty of enjoyable moments 
 the film includes an altogether extraneous subplot about the domestic problems between gavin's best friend 
 the film is a light and bouncy comedy-thriller 
 the film is a little over indulgent 
 the film is a smashing success . the central oddball here is the dude ( jeff bridges ) 
 the film is a tale of heroic adventure 
 the film is absolutely breathtaking . no other = director has even come close to realizing jerusalem during the time of = christ's life to the screen . peter gabriel contributes a score than is = simply astonishing 
 the film is also strong . the unifying motif -- that everything in life is a gamble -- is successfully delineated . oscar and lucinda don't just wager their money 
 the film is available on videocassette and dvd . the videocassette includes an intro by the beautiful jane jensen and an interview segment with lloyd kaufman 
 the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table . the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it . we're given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations 
 the film is commendable for the acting of chow and foster and the impressive set and costume designs of the film . anna and the king should also provide chow yun-fat the ability to finally move into a stronger category of american actors and achieve the notoriety he has held for so long in the east . would that it did more for the audience . 
 the film is damn funny 
 the film is deeply engrossing because of irons . as von bulow 
 the film is directed like a music video with a large budget . proyas uses fast cuts 
 the film is for you . i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low + 2 on the -4 to + 4 scale . 
 the film is immensely more entertaining . lions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films ( having picked up kevin smith's catholic-rattling dogma ) and here with american psycho there is no difference . screenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it . some cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc-17 
 the film is like a master painting . each cinematic brush stroke is carefully laid down by egoyan with the beauty building with each dollop of paint . with the final color in place 
" the film is never confusing . anderson's control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful . he also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of "" magnolia's "" scenes drag on too long . any three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending . from the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesn't get boring . it is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot . this is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation . every character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees . for example "
 the film is not quite up to par . if taken on its own merits however 
 the film is primarily concerned about scandals and spin control . although the film strays into some obviously non-clinton territory 
 the film is still in a class of it's own . finally 
 the film is thought provoking 
 the film is too long 
 the film is too short to take on such a multi-character focus 
 the film is ultimately most satisfying on the intimate scale of father and daughter . 
 the film is very effective and involving due to its subject matter 
 the film is very powerful . kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices 
 the film isn't too long to cause pain nor too short to not get the job done . 
 the film just exploded in the box-office 
 the film lacks a certain urgency . and those expecting present 007 pierce brosnan to be dodging explosions and attempting death-defying stunts should look elsewhere . this remake follows a more laid-back and conventional pace 
 the film looses most of its possibilities 
 the film might be better as a result . charlie mayough ( liam neeson ) is an undercover dea officer who is on his last assignment before retirement . the problem is 
 the film more or less plods along . it is only then that the film picks up the pace by showing that just four hours after the official announcement 
 the film never really spends enough time on them . some of the characters are very slight 
 the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year : a solid 
 the film only becomes more frightening . the way the realm of genetics is heading 
" the film plays like a very high quality version of any number of old "" twilight zone "" episodes where the characters spend a great deal of time wandering about looking afraid and disoriented "
" the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley ( the latter who's novel "" brave new world "" featured genetically engineered children ) . it's a film that may likely become a cult hit to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia "
 the film seems to be missing something that characterized its predecessor . and right now 
 the film seems to flounder 
 the film seems to have little going for it on first glance . the often documentary-type camera movements 
 the film slows down when we get into malkovich's head . it stops being a wacky comedy 
 the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above . after being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney 
 the film starts off extremely gloomy and inauspicious . rome's best general maximus ( russell crowe ) 
 the film starts out painfully slow 
 the film stock is rather primitive 
 the film takes a somber 
 the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction . frank darabont 
 the film was both entertaining and sweet 
 the film was originally slated for a direct-to-video release 
 the film was released at what could be the worst possible time 
 the film works 
 the film would have to do extremely well in order to make it's money back . but due to it's story 
 the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect 
 the film would lose it's message and descend into just being a sci-fi thriller a la william gibson . the suspense in the film comes from the idea that vincent and jerome can easily be captured just by dropping a hair or dead skin . while there are several scenes which are pretty frightening 
" the film would probably be weaker . it is also important to point out that both hall and plummer maintain their characters' core integrity throughout . plummer has an especially powerful scene after a newspaper editorial accuses "" 60 minutes "" of dishonoring "" the legacy of edward r murrow "" . both crowe ( in an oscar-nominated performance ) and pacino are terrific throughout "" the insider "" . they find just the right note of realism in their characters "
 the film's cast is up to the challenge 
 the film's few problems can be swept over to the side . the adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is 
 the film's fresh 
 the film's landscape 
 the film's major flaw may be that it spends too much time chronicling the rise and fall of hoskins' darcy 
 the film's okay . also on board are a band of mercenary pirates 
 the film's tempo loses its liveliness 
 the film's way-too-premature peak . she steps foot in the ballroom of the abandoned palace 
" the filmmaker was frustrated . "" we were trying to make a cautionary tale "
 the filmmakers work too hard to tidy things up 
" the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories : quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the "" film noir "" genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control ( fargo "
 the films writer and director 
 the final hour of john carpenter's vampires picks up speed and is highly entertaining . not much more may be said without giving away some of the plot's resolution ; however 
" the final moniker was a working title for "" scream "" "
" the final showdown between crow's "" gang "" and valek's "" posse "" in a deserted town combines the genres of the western and horror quite well . ultimately "

 the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound . in this regard 
 the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event . it runs 135 minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose 
 the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented . the script is characteristically weak 
 the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent . the viewers don't care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner . and right around the corner they usually are

 the most absurd moments are also the film's most realistic 
 the most disturbing scene is the taxi driver-like violence at the end when humbert confronts the monstrously amoral quilty in his own mansion . the film is visually rich 
 the most flamboyant bowler alive 
 the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other . annie wilson ( cate blanchett ) is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown . some of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale ( hilary swank ) 
 the most important of which is one's ability to choose one's own fate . hogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be : a hero . the final sequence is touching and appropriate 
 the most interesting tv genre of the '90s has been reality programming and jerry springer's popularity is through the roof

 the motivations for the killings are still a little thin at times ; i can understand that the characters had tracks to cover ( or at least thought they did ) 
 the motive is almost totally irrelevant to the movie . but sandler's philosophy seems to be

 the movielike a good comic booktransports us to another world .

 the movie becomes a story of culture clash 
 the movie becomes more and more surreal . unusually

" the movie entails the struggle of an american infantry company ( "" c-for-charlie "" ) to take a hill during the conflict at guadalcanal . the south pacific island is seen by the top brass as the key position for american armed forces to hold if they want to win the war . and want to win the war they do . in an excellent performance "
 the movie espouses 
 the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year . the reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly . if walter hill's idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america 
 the movie goes on full blast 
 the movie goes through twists and turns 
 the movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to it you can't get from 
 the movie has been appreciated 
 the movie has smart 
 the movie has some slightly sentimental bits 
 the movie holy man opened to a meager box office receipt and to indifference from audiences and critics . a real charmer of a movie 
 the movie inside of the movie begins . it starts out with kermit in a swamp 
 the movie is a long ( but moving ) experience 
 the movie is a one time deal you want want to re-visit and while ford isn't quite upstaged by his female companion 
 the movie is about 15 minutes too long 
 the movie is fun to watch thanks to its lively cast of young actors . 
 the movie is great fun . 
 the movie is less about the relationship between andreas and claire 
 the movie is not just about computer generated aliens . it's about computer generated aliens and a secret organization known as mib . if one wasn't green and running around the other would not exist as it's known . the computer graphics in this movie are spectacular 
 the movie is often outrageously exciting 
 the movie is played out for plenty of laughs . director harold ramis ( who also helmed the comedy multiplicity 
 the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end 
 the movie is smart 
 the movie is something like a card sharp . with its flashy mass stripped away 
 the movie is too long to just be taken as a light comedy 
 the movie is well made . sight 
 the movie isn't a complete failure . it offers some good laughs and a few vintage newman moments 
 the movie just tries so hard that you begin to forgive it and get into the swing of things . not that it's bad 
 the movie kept switching from kid-friendly fluff to scary monster flick . the dvd features a number of fascinating tidbits 
 the movie lacks soul . i think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade 
 the movie looked like a weird hybrid of blue streak 
 the movie maintains a high level of suspense . when supercilious and deceitful charles comes to pay a visit of indeterminate length with his sister and her family in petaluma 
 the movie makes an exception by sketching with deft irony and much affection buddy's mother 
 the movie not only achieves a scary undercurrent 
 the movie remains a good couple of hours to pass the time with . again 
 the movie represents a rethinking of the story's structure 
 the movie sets him up well and he's wonderful as usual . sadly the film is flawed 
 the movie shifts to another level and never leaves this high energy level until the ending credits roll down . as soon as the action starts 
 the movie slows to a crawl for about half an hour as the major conflict between jack crow and the original vamp valek is set up . whether you like john carpenter's vampires or not will largely depend upon whether or not you like the actors . james woods does a wickedly fun turn as the lead vampire slayer . he brings a manic energy which fits the character perfectly . thomas ian griffith deserves an equal nod as the very effective valek . he informs the vampire with a menacing quality equal to that of other classic actors like bela lugosi . if you do not like these actors 
 the movie starts to pick up with him finding a love interest in a 17 year old girl named debbie ( chloe sevigny ) and . . . i liked this movie alot even though it did not reach my expectation . after you've seen him in fargo and reservoir dogs 
 the movie still has an underlying heart and soul to it . in the original 
 the movie touches on few actual political issues . in fact 
 the movie uses raskolnikov-like figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america - its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade . brilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides . his travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today - many of us share his feelings of isolation 
 the movie was a huge hit when it opened there last year . now in theatrical release in the united states 
 the movie was also nice to look at ( especially the apes ! ) 
 the movie was carried mostly by the two rather `unknowns' 
" the movie was commercially successful and earned three "" oscars "" "
 the movie was good in creating his own atmosphere . professional nitpickers would probably have a field day in discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracies 
 the movie was what it proposed to be a rather shallow and witty comedy . that was achieved rather well 
 the movie works in 
 the movie's just a boatload of fun . funnest damn movie i've seen all year . 
 the movie-within-a-movie setup allows for plenty of jokey moments 
 the movies are all well made and i always get caught up in the story . the wings of the dove fits the pattern . kate ( helena bonham carter ) and merton ( linus roache ) are in love . merton 
 the movies are well made and the stories inevitably win me over . check out more current movie reviews at http : //www . indra . com/~mmapes/

 the mysterious businessman who hired craig and may know more about all of this than anyone suspects . the first half hour or so of this film is full of sly wit . not laugh out loud sight gags

 the narration is conducted by charlton heston 
 the nasty and evil practitioner who wants to knock nookey off his perch . some critics have said that this combination of hawtrey and stoppidge does not work well 
 the national guard never heard tom's initial distress call . will tom and karen survive the natural and manmade disasters ? opinion : don't expect thought-provoking issues or dramatics . there's not much more to this movie than hiding 
 the nature of his character's speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive . carrie-anne moss plays trinity 
 the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it's reality . we're served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best . as an audience 
 the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible 
 the neighbor 
 the neighing of horses 
 the net effect of the vignette on the film's thematic narrative is rather dubious . if anything 
" the new comedy from director mike nichols ( "" primary colors "" "

 the next stellar monster or effect will have you muttering 
 the nicely-titled hopper . and for the romantic lead 
 the night of the hunter 
 the night of the hunter is by far the scariest movie i've seen so far this year . even though the movie is nearly 50 years old and there's a not drop of blood to be seen . luckily 
 the nightmare is just beginning 
 the noblest man on the police force 
 the non-cynics anyway

 the object of my affection and sliding doors 
 the obligatory sub-plot that ties many of the characters' complex relationships together . 
" the obscurity that "" blue velvet "" relies on is enough to make this film enjoyable . since its elements are so originally weird "
 the odds are even more against you . melvin ( jack nicholson ) is a successful romance author who is just the opposite of what you would expect someone in that profession to be . a solitary man hidden away in his new york apartment with no human interaction and not even a hint of ever having been in a passionate relationship 
" the offending party is the preview for "" what lies beneath "" "
" the often-invisible beings pass through the body and wrench out its soul ( for some unexplainable reason ) . while many humans agree with a plan by monomaniacal general hein ( james woods ) to blast the aliens with a "" zeus cannon "

 the ominous feeling of doom is palpable 
 the once suicidal lomper ( steve huison ) 
 the one here 
 the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into . it's almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance ( totally based on looks alone ) . of course 
 the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact . watching schindler's list was a powerful 
 the only real standout is newcomer anna faris 
 the only thing to top this or come close would be the mangalores in the fifth element . this was all done thanks to jim henson's workshop of puppeteers . henson died two months after this film was released . though his family and many others still work to make his legacy live on 
 the only things the filmmakers wish us to know is that todd is a killing machine and the person in charge is a really bad guy . what follows is the standard sci-fi cliche of the underdog against a supposedly superior opponent ; in this case 
 the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert and lolita . more importantly 
 the only two residents who are aware the winner is in their village . the two men eventually find the ticket 
 the only way he can win his own freedom and complete his goal is to become a winning gladiator

 the original alien . however 
 the original cut of this underwater sci-fi thriller was entertaining enough but also quite seriously flawed . the main problem was fairly simple : the film's climax was unworthy of its build-up . someone at 20th century fox - and no doubt cameron himself - must have agreed 
 the original insurance investigator in the 1968 version

" the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their "" peaceful beach community "
 the owner 
 the owner of a chain of french fried frog leg restaurants has a different idea . he wants kermit to be his spokesman 
 the pace tends to drag and many in the audience will tire of the film . the 1934 version told much the same story in half the time . with judicious trimming of some unnecessary padding 
 the package might become cruise's computer disk . fortunately 
 the pageant defines 
 the parents ( one of which is played by paul reubens 
 the part of doc played by peter butterworth and sheriff albert earp played by jon pertwee are not really necessary 
 the peacemaker . unfortunately 
 the peak of its planned illogicality is not immediately apparent . you may get distracted by the broad shenanigans and forget that dreyfuss-simms speaks spanish-accented english throughout 
 the people begin to wonder . when kent mansley ( a government agent ) comes to investigate he discovers hogarth's fake gun near the power plant and questions him about it 
 the perfect pleasantville mother 
 the performances by the special effects are generally better than the performances by the actors

 the plot isn't the most elaborate of tales ( alien bad 
" the plot isn't unlike many children's sitcoms in which the "" good "" kid's "" bad "" friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid . what this film does is use a different medium to tell that story . mike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives "

" the problems with the tibetan political system is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses "" we were just about to change things "" after the chinese attack . the film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography of roger deakins . his lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture with luscious detail . especially striking is an extreme moving close up of a sand mandala grain by grain . the visual treats more than make up for the movie's faults creating a poetic meditation for the audience . walking out of the theater you feel like you have awakened from a transcendental experience . martin scorsese "

 the situation comedy is quite funny 
 the situations felt authentic

" the spiritual and political leader of tibet . the movie's title is another name for the dalai lama which means "" ocean of wisdom .

 the story is quite appealing 
 the story is still fascinating 
 the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original . there are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic 
 the story is very thin . none of the characters ( except the old local matchmaker ) are nearly as interesting as garofalo . some of the characters

 the woman who had an affair with his father . ok 
 the woman who shot andy warhol in 1968 . but the film is more of a showcase to the ways of the 60s and the influence that warhol and other artists had on the people at that time . valerie jean solanas ( taylor ) is a lesbian feminist who as written a book called scum manifesto

 their 10-year old son is the smartest one in the group 
 their are almost too many characters in the film 
 their blood turned to powder in their veins . some went insane before they died and two of them 
 their bodies somewhere else . mostly dead silent 
 their boss . so all the gangster number one needs to worry about is his enemies on the other side of the fence . but this film brings the betrayals 
 their enjoyment spreads to the audience . grade : b 
 their faces smeared across the wide-angle lens . this film camera is just another one of the guys . tiptoeing that indistinguishable line between fantasy and reality 
 their fame is increasing 
 their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment . the story centers on veronica franco ( catherine mccormack ) 
" their love for eachother is never doubted or even tested . another thing i really liked is emily watson's performance . i usually make it a note to never overpraise an actor for playing either a drunkard or a lunatic or someone with a mortal disease ( or any combination of the three ) . my reasoning for this is that it's a fucking easy job . the worst case for this very year may be thandie newton in "" beloved "" : sure "
 their mode of speech -- all are virtually identical . a running gag is made of the way bateman is constantly mistaken for others ( he doesn't even bother to correct the error 
" their online relationship grows stronger . "" you've got mail "" is as artificial as movies come . everything is nice and happy and by the end "
 their only map disappears 
 their performances are almost invisible . the greatest performance in the film comes suprisingly from the young kristen dunst 
 their relationship becomes sexual 
 their relationship builds and neither knows what to do with it . star-crossed lovers with no where to go . so hutton is gaga over a barely-teen 
 their relationship is never strained 
 their relationship is sad because marco is married to a women he is unable to love 
 their relationship is that of a reverend and a confessor 
 their relationships with each other 
 their roles are miniature compared with walken's 
 their routine consists of getting drunk at the local pub 
 their style of dress 
 their treatment of her still seems cruel and passionless . the storyline's only major fault is to suggest that montoya falls in love with her . crow's treatment of members of the catholic priesthood will probably offend some too . in one scene 
 their trek goes awry 
 their trips turn nastier and the consequences worse

" then american pie is for you . if you're one of those "" conservative "" types "
 then asks the priest whether he was turned on by the abuse or not . despite these faults 
 then beating up a bully in a marketplace 
" then being a loser and not thinking i am . "" well put . the story starts to take off when his uncle dies "
 then continued from a new angle . this is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semi-circle 
 then decides she's at a local love club . but in order get the phone number there they have to call a tax auditor . the idiot worsens pierre's back problems and screws up any of his chances of getting back together with his wife . a complex plot is soon laid out in the household . another film from veber that is full to the brim with original comic ideas . name one comedy that takes happens in one place 
 then entombed . . . all while still alive . recap a few thousand years later 
 then finally let us go 
 then forgotten by her owner . it may be computer-animated 
 then fox ) 
 then giving that up to fully embrace millie . millie's part didn't require as much range 
 then goes off to interview griffith 
 then he works construction . off-screen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him . on-screen he hangs out with his friends 
 then i pity you for making me a primary source for your entertainment news . either way

 then in forrest gump 
" then insults the quality of their movies and informs them that the only reason he's there is because "" my guys always put the big jews on my schedule . "" all throughout this physically and politically suicidal escapade "
 then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman . and like his other miserable friends 
 then it 
 then it turns out to be a tv signal of the berlin olympics bounced back to earth from 50 years before . further decoding 
 then it was a turn for the better 
 then it's crap . but if a film last 2 1/2 hours 
 then it's excellent . boogie nights falls into the latter catagory . the director 
 then jumps right over it . by the end 
 then knock you down by taking it one step further 
" then morrie sounds like the world's foremost pop psychologist . and that's part of the problem i had watching the adaptation . albom claims that morrie was "" a force "" in the classroom "
 then moving on . if you didn't think this was harsh enough 
 then nothing will . 
 then one will be remarkedly disappointed . a menage a trois does occur between the two ladies and matt dillon 
" then perhaps this will : the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude's rug . they've mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the "" big "" lebowski ( david huddleston ) and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny ( tara reid ) owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) . the dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug ; he doesn't have any luck "
 then placed against painted backdrops recreating the vastness of 18th century paris . this recreation calls attention to itself in every shot 
 then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal . jackie passes ordell's test 
 then relapse into mumbling again . your eyes open and close like frustrated curtains as you drift between alertness and snoozing . the self-destructive feelings are heightened if you haven't eaten 
 then repeated in patterns . these patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of a larger composition . people won't be flocking to kundun for it's great ending 
" then reveals that he was 107 years old . but "" guantanamera "" is not simply an entertainment . it is a movie about life "
 then someone else walks by and the camera follows that person 
 then spacey took him out -- but being a movie 
 then starts concocting tidbits to keep the money flowing . before long 
 then starts the journey all over again . alvin's slow voyage from iowa to wisconsin provides the framework around which the bulk of the movie is built . as is often the case in these sorts of films 
" then stops and reminds us that ordinary people live there too . "" slacker "" is a good film and a wonderfully offbeat and entertaining comedy "
 then take him on as a student and thrash him some more . this turns out to be su hua-chi 
 then the ending is our test . everything is told from mike's perspective 
 then the genre's gonna thrive for a long while . once again 
 then the image is not convincing 
 then the movie can't be all that bad . hank azaria ( the birdcage ) plays albom 
 then the political pressure 
 then the scream of hysteria you hear will be from me . after all 
 then the world's greatest orchestra conductor stayed in germany and cooperated with the nazis . what were his views 
 then they take the long walk up the stairs and down the hallway 
 then this film is definitely for you . it isn't the most original premise in the world 
 then this film would even been even better . as said before 
 then this is a decidedly unwise move : the same prank was pulled in the brother's dumb and dumber 
 then this movie is definitely for you ! it's the kind of film that you actually have to see twice to fully appreciate ( damn 
 then tom and viv 
 then walk on . one of the characters ( schwarzenegger ) slips 
 then went up the lift 
 then what works here is the powerful romance between virgil and amy . mira sorvino is a terrific actress 
 then when you look back 
 then you can drop my rating down about 1/2 a star or maybe a full star . if you're a huge turtle fan ( i don't think there's any of those left . . . hello ? hello out there ? ) then you can add on another 1/2 star . but if you're like me 
 then you have a problem with the genre itself : armageddon is as good as a film like this can be . if you've seen deep impact 
 then you know the basic framework for the story . it turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film . so 
 then you obviously haven't seen the previews . you're going to see this movie for bloody 
 then you've basically got jerry fletcher . in many ways 
 theo 
 there appears to be a couple of duds 
 there are 3 big 
" there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass . whereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying "" eight months later "
 there are a couple of plot developments that are left unresolved 
" there are a few thoughtful movies - and this appalachian period drama is one . oscar nominee janet mcteer ( "" tumbleweeds "" ) stars as dr . lily penleric "
 there are a number of smaller fictional and non-fictional roles thrown in for color 
 there are definitely elements intended for both age groups 
 there are faults 
 there are flaws that somewhat spoil bread and tulips' cheery tone . rosalba is bothered by several surreal dreams during her time in venice 
 there are moments when she doesn't seem all that convincing . the movie was filmed in texas 
 there are no big distractions from the point of the film 
 there are no caricatures . instead 
 there are no lapses in credibility . heist is probably the best mamet thriller since house of games . it is the kind of plot with which you are never sure who will double-cross whom 
 there are no winners . the film was shot on location 
 there are only a few spots in the film that seem bare 
" there are plenty of subtle nods to movies like "" the usual suspects "
 there are points of turmoil 
 there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into 5 days of drama in 1970 . the special effects by digital domain are up to standard and the music suits the suspense and drama very well 
 there are real people that have suffered greatly over the politics connected to the canal . director john boorman adds additional verisimilitude by shooting the film on location . instead of using panama city merely as a colorful backdrop 
 there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business ( nudge nudge ) . several twists turn in the storyline 
 there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks . the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual . of the several dozen actors to play azazel 
" there are so many things wrong with it that they can hardly be counted . it's derivitive of costner's own "" waterworld "" and clint eastwood westerns . there's little here that we haven't seen dozens of times before . the film is often down-right corny . a scene where the postman is on horseback and grabs a letter from the hands of a bright-eyed child is embarrassing in its slow-motion banality . the film's final few minutes should have been left on the cutting room floor . despite the film's excessive three hour length "
 there are some great ones here . harold pinter is amusing as harry's uncle benny 
 there are some impressive computer-generated visuals down below . unfortunately 
 there are some inconsistencies in how frank's actions ripple down to his son ) 
 there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun . wild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality 
" there are some very funny lines ( ripley : "" who do i have to fuck to get off this boat ? ! "" johner : "" well "
" there are some visual elements that other directors seem to have borrowed from the night of the hunter . powell's "" love "" and "" hate "" knuckle tattoos obviously influenced spike lee in do the right thing ( remember radio raheem ? ) . and powell's black suit "
" there are some wonderful moments . melvin is hilarious in his grouchiness and touching as he attempts to be nice . "" you make me want to be a better man "
 there are those select few who may look slightly ugly 
 there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up 
 there are two warring families whom you can't tell apart until they are yelling at each other . you connect with cacao ( antonio canales ) because he is followed throughout the film . he is charismatic 
 there comes a point when the quiet 
 there doesn't seem to be much original work added to this production 
 there happens to be this huge crime wave sweeping new york 
 there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic . i partially disagree with this 
 there have been four other notable versions sandwiched in between . two in 1952 
 there is ( ahem * ) black people 
 there is a desire to be taken someplace new and exciting 
 there is a distance between the audience and the movie . the film is more concerned with visuals and history and less so with human beings . with the exception of a few scenes 
 there is a head-to-head between rumpo and marshall . with the rumpo's past experience 
 there is a hefty amount of dramatic material hidden at it's core . but the comedic aspects work wonderfully 
 there is a hint of detail reminiscent of a documentary style approach by director richard linklater ( 'dazed and confused' 
 there is a song to go with it that is passed down from one generation to the next . gatlif has managed to utilize an old 
 there is a strong connection through disney's lens between the cell of a monastery and a prison cell . but for all the heavy commentary 
 there is a tremendous demand by movie lovers ( never mind movie critics ) for movies that present the wide film audience with something truly original : perhaps audaciously 
 there is a very gradual change in the sheriff . he begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors . what i really enjoyed about steiger's character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film . he still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil . instead 
 there is a wonderful 
 there is a young boy named conejo ( dan rivera gonzlez ) 
 there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes 
 there is an incredible palette of colors 
 there is an incredible shot at night in which the camera crosses the tracks in front of a fast oncoming train . i don't know if the shot is faked in any way 
 there is an outstanding scene where grace darts outside 
" there is hardly any music at all in "" rules of engagement "" . during the courtroom and battle scenes "
 there is huge explosions 
 there is nary a hint of james bond flash here . instead of big action scenes 
 there is no denying the director's brilliance as a stylist . many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork . they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light 
 there is no dinner or no game at all . the film's comedy owes almost everything to villeret 
 there is no doubt that you will laugh . based on the wildly popular comedy central tv show 
 there is no way to know how accurate the film is 
 there is one : evil monk rasputin ( spoken by christopher lloyd 
 there is only a brief mention the shooting of dr . gunn in florida 
 there is only one option now . you can forget about calling the police 
 there is plenty to be amused by in the film 
 there is repetitive whining about how men aren't suppose to cry or show emotion . still 
 there is some sexual tension between the two . luckily 
 there is something about it that holds your attention despite all of this . i suppose it could be the two leads 
 there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor ( or his voice at least ) . with `the phantom menace' being the first chapter of a long saga 
 there is the music . this was probably the most obvious thing to me 
 there isn't an annoying character like chris tucker from the other film 
 there isn't any ( except if you count a whiner/wimp who only shows his true colors when it's too late ) . then again 
 there isn't many big suspense set pieces 
 there isn't very much of it shown during the film . in a way 
 there remains something satisfying about seeing elwood build himself a new family to hold his life together 
" there seem to be two reactions to dark city . you either love it or you are unimpressed . count me as a "" love it . "" as good as the crow and spawn are "
 there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillon's characters 
 there was a delightful 1960's don adams show ( that fox unsuccessfully tried to bring back a few years ago ) called get smart . richard gautier 
 there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography . the predictable ending that shattered our hopes ( even though we saw it coming ) only added to the disappointment . but for over an hour 
 there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points-of- view 
 there was a moron waving a laser pointer across the screen during certain scenes -- the first time i've encountered this particular brand of rudeness at a local theatre . intriguingly 
 there was a sly little comedy called the freshman 
 there was the frequency preview . it looked awful . it looked cheesy 
 there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham . there's no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise 
 there were obvious metaphorical connections 
 there would be a little twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky . the last sequence was perfect and managed to go even further over-the-top . although i enjoyed the film immensely 
" there's a "" franks and beans "" scene about every fifteen minutes here "
 there's a climax where everyone's shooting at everyone else -- but in this case 
" there's a first ) . ) "" the first one was [good] "
 there's a great discussion about lady & the tramp by the main characters . the disco tunes playing in the background also make sure that this admittedly long film is good fun . the direction is good 
" there's a little bit of all of that in "" the wedding singer "" and while i exited the theater still not one hundred percent sure of mr . sandler's thing "
 there's a lot of gunplay . when a character is letting go with an automatic weapon 
 there's a much meatier movie in here . . . it just takes a while to get out . that's not to say that there's not a place for humor in this film . in fact 
" there's a stunt during this scene that comes close to challenging the "" bus jumping the ramp "" sequence from speed in the "" oh "
 there's always a tricky patriotic balancing act of theory against practice 
 there's an intense scene of primitive childbirth . on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 
 there's another romance brewing . i will not let the cat out of the bag except to say that mariano is at the love story's epicenter 
 there's anthony hopkins 
 there's even a little twin peaks to be found here 
 there's jennifer lopez . unintentionally funny in selena and intentionally funny in anaconda 
 there's just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what's going on . come to think of it 
 there's liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout 
 there's little that's special about this tale -- it follows a traditional narrative path 
 there's little to hold on to because we feel like we don't know these people . i would have been content just watching rolf try to win back the confidence of his wife and kids ; rolf's struggle to gain redemption is fully believable and the sturdiest branch on the plot tree . so much goes on that it's not nearly as effective as it should be . the director is too busy looking at the repressed family next door 
 there's mckellar's friend 
 there's more . . . i actually got choked up 
" there's mr . myagi . . . "" "" good . "" "" and mr . sulu . "" "" perfect . we've got ourselves a movie now . "" soon disney really _will_ be able to paint with all the colors of the wind . visit the movie critic at large homepage at http : //www . missouri . edu/~c667778/movies . html close to 1 "
 there's much more to it than that 
 there's never any surprise during heist's twisting . mamet has just become lazy with this one . everything about the film looks great 
 there's no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film . while he's adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense 
 there's no record of the accident 
 there's no ridiculous singing characters here 
 there's no tangible chemistry between paltrow and mortensen 
 there's not a whiff of football 
 there's nothing big going for it 
 there's nothing inspired about either davidtz's or sutherland's work . both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts 
 there's one who happens to share the same philosophy espoused by the central character in darren aronofsky's darkly original pi : the entire stock market can be reduced to nothing but a series of patterns which 
 there's plenty of potential for a wicked black comedy 
 there's some pretty imaginative deaths 
 there's something a little off . it's a minor problem : they do work well together 
 there's something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater . 
 there's something mistrustful about him 
 there's stephen furst as albert 
 there's still plenty of time to spill your popcorn all over the place . robert mitchum stars as harry powell 
 there's the always cool-as-hell billy bob thornton as dan truman 
 there's the hope of creating a mass collage . it's not as easy to pull off as you might think -- consider the rhythm of your standard daytime soap opera . the concept of three juxtaposed narratives 
 there's very little against bulworth 
 there've been moments of sweetness in his prior films -- the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer 
 thereby becoming a distraction right when you definitely don't need a distraction . finally 
 thereby earning the respect of their white peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner . like any war film 
 thereby escaping his apparent fate to carry on the family plumbing business . another subplot involves his father's desperate attempts to force fate's hand by gambling away his life at the dog track . a distracting focus is put on alan's debt to a loan shark and the manner in which he pays it off . the movie tries too hard to make alan a likable guy . thankfully 
 thereby making memphis have to improvise . . . thereby adding some meat to the plot . the finale is essentially just a big car chase 
 therefore putting any academy awards chances it has off until this time in 1999 . it's actually a smart move 
 therefore there is no real downfall to witness . but 
 theresa russell 
" these "" aliens "" are all migrant workers . that is "
 these are elements that i would prefer in a comedy 
 these are high school kids - does offer hugo a subtle motive of sorts . the young man considers himself the basketball team's prime utility man who does a little bit of everything - pass 
 these creatures of the night continue to rake in profits . subtle changes in the vampire myths as they get translated through the decades may allow for enough variety to keep people interested . this year 
 these devices become as predictable as harry's long list of solutions . the movie is not a weighty one 
 these dudes are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person . . . that is 
 these excellent fight scenes are few and far between 
 these feelings are present . this is why james dean is admired by america 
 these films have begun to fascinate me immensely . the latest entry into the genre 
 these items do have importance to the rest of the story 
 these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented 
 these peaceful people can't horde this fountain of youth all for themselves  leave it up to their archenemies 
 these plot twists are actually unpredictable . going along the way of scream 
 these questions envelope maggie 
 these raptors look a little different also 
 these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action sci-fi film that for once does more than merely entertain . 
 these things are nothing more than serviceable to john woo's unique directorial style . he's a master at this kind of movie making . if you see hard target 
 these two are the only ones who excel . everyone else 
 these two email each other silly 
 these two have their entire lives ahead of them . they are young enough to still believe in magic 
 these works were big popular hits in their time . but today 
 thespian-at-large 
 they act completely natural and never give any sort of nervous reaction that maybe he knows . and i liked the way douglas seemed to have everything figured out 
 they actually want to make some bad times look better . nice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the 1970s . for new generations 
 they agree to meet again the next day . but as cesar walks outside 
 they all grow and become intelligent . the rat teaches the turtles the martial arts and he saw his previous master practice so many times before 
 they all seem to agree 
 they also become friends with a judith hoag who plays the new reporter april o'neil 
 they are also more sympathetic . in this story they are not just killing machines 
 they are amazed by the implementation of color . then they want to have it . then they do not want to . then the war ensues between the colored and non-colored . this is all strung out over two hours 
 they are bitter competitors . she owns a quaint little children's bookstore 
 they are both propositioned and both nearly succumb to the temptation to play around with someone else . when they return to their lavish new york apartment kidman ( after smoking a dash of weed ) inquires whether her husband had sex with two models who approached him during the night . he ( truthfully ) says that he did not and asks what happened with that hungarian guy she was dancing with . they proceed to argue until alice tells her spouse a lustful story : evidently some time ago 
 they are bound to recognize the titles : airplane ! 
 they are captured and end up in the headquarters of fegan floop ( alan cumming ) 
" they are chaotic and horrifying ; it's just that director edward zwick ( the co-creator of "" thirtysomething "" ) films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster . the key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers . the movie depicts some of ( but not enough of ) their customs and rituals . in one scene "
 they are gorgeous . immediately 
 they are in mortal danger . as depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel 
" they are just "" borrowing "" it . kevin "
 they are largely successful . ffing becomes known as 'the black fingernail' because he leaves a calling card behind which shows two fingers sticking up 
 they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught 
 they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance 
" they are never anything more than "" abolitionists . "" nigel hawthorne "
 they are nice to listen to ( they're well sung aswell . ) the musical score is suitably epic 
 they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co-workers to think you had such a great time watching them . with their current film 
" they are one "" big "
" they are overshadowed by amanda peet's ( "" isn't she great "" "
 they are reminded of how they wouldn't let julia roberts' character shop in the expensive stores because of her appearance . then it hits them : they are not successful . what are she and michele going to do ? romy's instant solution is lose some weight off their already slender frames 
 they are such a perfect screen match that one cannot help but develop a rooting interest for their coupledom . i just wish that the character of vince was better written . one minute he's a jerk 
 they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime . some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples 
 they awake the title character . soon enough 
 they become part of each others' story ( not necessarily an important or even significant part 
 they begin to discover that they have a lot in common with each other . meanwhile 
 they begin to drift apart . the inevitable tragedy 
 they bet their hearts 
 they blend with the rest of the film quite well . the cast members work very well together 
 they boast 
 they bop to the music and skeet shoot out the back of the vehicle 
" they build you a shopping mall . "" their isolation on the island puts them into an unpleasant confrontation with some modern day pirates . they also deal with the conflict of each other's opposite tendencies "
 they can't deal with the threat of any other studio getting even a small piece of the crust of the kiddie entertainment pie 
 they can't learn everything - there's plenty more episodes of the series to be had 
 they come off as old-fashioned 
 they come to an unspoken understanding of how much each means to the other . frances' adult son 
 they compensate violently for not having what they feel should be simply given to them gratis ) . hall ( played by chris o'donnell with maturity and grace ) also has a transformation of his own 
 they cont inually meet 
 they could have had a classic on their hands . instead 
" they counter with an old "" masterpiece "" from their vault and "
 they decide that they should get an apartment with a young woman as well 
 they decide to adopt stuart 
" they decide to boost interest in the group by promising "" the full monty "" on opening night "
 they devise numerous schemes of sometimes mindboggling complexity -- but every time 
 they discover a young woman sitting in the house . her name is beloved 
 they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don't leave them alone . when she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film 
 they do what they can to get away without killing anyone in the process . secondly is the film's closing credits which are accompanied by footage of the johnny carson show where the real willis newton is interviewed by carson and we see the real joe newton in clips of home movies and they tell how the brothers always viewed banks and insurance companies as cheats themselves and that his gang was just one thief robbing from another . not a great justification of their profession 
 they don't amount to anything as serious or thought provoking as the schindler's list . overall 
" they don't know about his nefarious activities . he showers them with elaborate gifts to buy the love they had already given him anyway . two mysterious and exceedingly clean-cut writers for a magazine show up to take pictures of the family for a spread on the "" average american family "
 they don't seem like hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything of the sort any more ; they just seem like a couple of stoned jerks in a diner . duke seems to realize at some level that he's become something he doesn't like 
" they fight "" to the death ! ! "" . it's a charming premise "
 they finally get past the intros and onto the rehearsal scenes . like a play 
" they find a drunk who wants them "" to do "" his wife . well "
 they find themselves in a part of town none of them has ever seen before . ray is determined to get them to the boxing match on time 
 they find themselves standing at attention and receiving their orders from the extremely hard and punishing sergeant hartman 
 they found people that know their parts as govenment officials well . it seemed to me that garner played almost exactly the same role that he played in the distinquished gentleman ( except then he was a congressman ) . experience counts for a lot ! ! 
 they gamble 
 they get drawn back to the business . shortly into their first joint mission 
 they get separated from weitzman and are left to fend for themselves in manhattan . the movie's charm derives mostly from the camaraderie and chemistry between its delightful cast . the four leads in the film play off each other quite effectively ; they never miss an opportunity to argue 
 they get to use jet packs 
 they gradually learn to communicate . aside from cinque 
 they had predictable and formulaic plot 
 they had so much fun being together that they did not care about the others . that they make their own outlandish clothes helped keep the wall around them . complementing romy and michele's lightness 
 they had to run through that web of car tires before they were ready for battle . sung by donnie osmond ( a bad sign if ever there was one ) 
 they hate each other so much that we know that they are 
 they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon ( yeah 
 they have immense chemistry and are able to carry the entire film past even it's most gaping of flaws . 
 they have only one possible suspect : wayland ( tim roth ) 
 they have pushed the envelope as far as it can possibly go . the south park movie is more raunchy 
 they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition . this time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized . each new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs 
 they have some good timing 
 they have succeeded 
 they have succeeded . shakespeare in love is one of the smartest 
 they have to go without shoes 
 they hear fast food workers on interference and figure that they know . so 
 they instead fell in love 
 they interrupt 
 they just didn't know quite how to get to it . they struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high . filmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on 
 they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre : intelligence . even horror films have learned this 
 they later approached spielberg and ordered him to make another movie with alien 
 they learn than a weird old cripple and his sons live in the area 
 they learn the movie is rated r 
 they live 
 they lose all of their money gambling to a hotshot whom they later find dead right in front of their eyes . the man was beaten to death by a cop 
" they make "" six days "
 they make everyone look and feel great . 
 they make it through a halting conversation . at the hotel 
 they make love and 
 they make us feel like we're watching developed 
 they make you want to believe that aliens like the ones depicted exits . since seeing this movie i have to agree concede that denis rodman is an alien 
 they managed to do it in an interesting and funny way . the movie starts with a quick ( and i do mean quick ) glance of two presidents russell kramer ( jack lemmon ) and matt douglas ( james garner ) . william haney ( dan aykroyd ) and ted matthews ( john heard ) are the new president and vice president . there is a scandal that arises involving a kickback from a contractor and haney is positive that he buried that years ago . he finds a scapegoat in kramer and now everyone wants kramer and douglas dead . this movie was exceptional for many reasons . one being that they found people ( lemmon and garner ) that have good chemisty together . they worked very well as a unit and they mirrored each other perfectly 
 they managed to do it without sacrificing a single testicle . 
 they meet charly ( patrick mercado ) and fredo ( jo prestia ) 
 they meet with failure and are nabbed by the oafish mr tweedy ( tony haygarth ) . observes ginger 
 they merely deliver a very good time at the movies . 
 they met by train ) 
 they most likely wouldn't be able to hold up . so 
 they move onto the booker ranch with the rest of tom's family 
 they nearly lost me with the tad-too-long intros . as delightful as it was 
" they need a new singer . his entry and adaptation to the whole "" rock 'n roll "" lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch . although i will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love ( or past love ) of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it . metal was one of my first loves as a teen and even though the genre of music isn't that prominent anymore "
 they need to find another contestant whom would be a worthy role model and the people will look up to and cheer to win . someone who can defeat stempel 
 they need to stay around a pg-13 rating ) . there's always one at the beginning with some chick we never see again 
 they never acted again . never once do they raise their voices or put any emphasis on a given word . instead of using vocal inflection 
 they pay themselves ) 
 they probably won't give me the card anyway 
 they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class . they're two-thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child . meanwhile 
 they put in cloaked figures to block some of the actual sex acts ( they can still be seen 
 they regularly meet on tuesdays--morrie's old office hours . jack lemmon plays morrie 
 they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey . they are tricked 
 they remain believable ( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children ) . also 
 they remain virtually unknown compared to the likes of john dillinger 
 they repeat their friends . . . they sound natural . taken with fargo 
 they repeat themselves 
 they run into problems with every place they go to 
 they say 
 they served as nothing more than a comic relief . it is a real shame to see kelly 
" they should pursue actors as talented and experienced as pryce to breathe life into these cardboard figures . there a few too many explosions in "" tomorrow never dies "" "
 they still carry more wit than the contemporary disney animated films . the lead character 
 they stopped doing it after the scene i've just described . coincidence ? ) not all the jokes are winners 
 they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths . based on the german film wings of desire ( that being the english title 
" they systematically consume "" two bags of grass "
 they take control of the vessel 
 they take their case to president clinton 
 they talk 
 they tend to work out well . there is no general antagonist in this film 
 they then fly out to hollywood to appear on television . after the appearance on television 
 they travel to paris 
 they try an make a life for themselves around the time of an uprising against the french monarchy . cosette's semi-romantic involvement with a young revolutionary ( hans matheson ) is the film's weak spot 
" they urinate on his rug . the problem is that the dude doesn't have a wife . his assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment . the "" big "" lebowski ( david huddleston ) is a multi-millionaire and his dudeness lives in two-room squalor . the next day "
 they usually just key in on one character whose main objective is to be funny ( jar-jar binks 
 they were so scandalous that beaumarchais was thrown into prison more than once . the movie beaumarchais : the scoundrel takes a light-hearted approach to its subject 
 they will all dine together at the judge's house not long before the case begins . court tv junkies will probably pick up the many differences 
 they will be sold to a japanese toy museum 
 they won't stop there . how many groups 
 they worked on the mysterious x-files 
 they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives . hell 
 they'd never look at him the same way . he ignites the screen with intensity 
" they're all quite engaging . even the movie's more "" serious "" moments are played with a wink . heche has been under undeserved fire over whether or not her private life with ellen degeneres would affect the "" believability "" of "" six days "
 they're as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance 
 they're going to learn a lot more about the mysterious conspiracy that's being run behind the scenes worldwide 
 they're not dissuasive and remain fairly enjoyable . briskly paced with a smart 
 they're not quite what they seem . walter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties . everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam . when a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but won't admit it 
 they're pretty good ) 
 they're right ; the rich man's wife has nary one original bone in it's body . but who cares ? if you're looking for good ol' dumb suspense movie 
 they've been around in books and on film for many 
 thieving street hoods 
 things change 
" things do get a bit too sappy and sentimental towards the end . if it had been trimmend down some from its 112 minute running time i probably would have given it four stars . one last thing i must note is that annette bening plays a real-estate agent in the film ( "" american beauty "" "
 things don't develop the way you'd expect when the authorities receive evidence of this transmission . ziminski gets fired 
 things don't get better 
 things don't go exactly as planned . lily ( sheila reid ) and chloe ( sandra voe ) are a couple of old friends who are frequent funeral attendees . death is a topic of endless fascination for them 
 things just happen to him . arriving home one night 
 things pick up heading into the home stretch 
 things start to fall apart . two of the members of the band pretty much disappear 
 things tend to drag some . we're also introduced to someone that may possibly be the most irritating character i've seen in years . jason ( i believe played by andrew lauer ) is a big time wallstreet dealer 
 think about every possibility . murder has that kind of banter . i just wish the film had been about more . i kept waiting for it to ask questions movies like this never ask . for instance 
 thinking he is an alien life-form . soon things get way out of hand 
 thinking i was going to tell you he was doing off-broadway theater . you silly goose . well 
 thinking individuals . like douglas 
 thinking that she is wearing a diguise and is really the fingernail ! jacqueline is imprisoned in the bastille and camembert 
 thinking to myself that i wanted something more out of this than just an off-kilter satire of drug culture . thankfully 
 thinks he's jesus . and finally 
" thinks his wife is going insane . with "" what lies beneath "" "
 thinks of himself as nothing but an empty 
 third party involved who is manipulating both sides . when the scene ends in tragedy 
 thirty minutes into the film

 this allows john to speak to frank in 1969 via the ham radio . john manages to convince his father that he really is communicating from the future by predicting events of the mets/orioles world series 
" this also backfires a bit on the film : instead of being the flashlight in the darkened room that "" the game "" was "
 this and many other offensive scenarios are almost too eager to cross the line into disgusting vulgarity . south park : bigger 
 this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity . for the second picture in a row 
 this being a political film 
 this being our second trip through gotham 
 this can be a very outstanding movie . 
 this can be forgiven . also in the supporting cast 
 this carry on centres around the arrival of the rumpo kid ( sidney james ) and his cronies in stodge city . his dodgy dealings and summary shootings aggravate judge burke ( kenneth williams ) so much that he asks sheriff albert earp ( jon pertwee ) to drive rumpo out of town . instead 
 this carry on was sid james and kenneth williams' favourite . a very different carry on film 
 this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years 
 this could have been one of the year's best . email tim chandler at timbit@canada . com check out the bottom line at http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/heights/8000/index . html for more reviews ! 
 this could never be a man who inspires hundreds to follow him 
" this creative "" borrowing "" really didn't bother me all that much . they say it's hard to be original . i don't know . technically "
 this creature kills all but one or two of the crew 
 this didn't bother me a bit . ) judd carries her role with a meg ryan-esque charm that should prove valuable in future productions 
 this digital effect is only used in one scene that i am aware of ( for about twenty seconds ) and if you aren't looking for it you won't even be able to tell . some of the other digital effects are less convincing however . . . and like i always say 
 this documentary is jam-packed with contagious energy . but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending 
 this doesn't distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film 
 this doesn't seem to appear until nearly over a hour into the film 
 this exact cycle repeats monotonously throughout the 73 minutes . news footage of violence becomes repetitive 
 this fight continues . it is very apparent at times which side is winning the battle and in some scenes there is a direct switch from angry to caring or the opposite . when carter sees that white canadians want to help him get out of prison 
 this film comes hot on the heels of the center city fire that claimed the lives of three firefighters 
 this film could be the most godawful thing they've ever seen . gone is the quick fire humour and standard 
 this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim 
 this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained . i didn't liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness . if you're going to tell a story from the beginning - tell it from the beginning ( is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes -1 through -3 to clarify the back story even further ? ) . but i digress . i've said so much and yet i haven't even touched on the specifics of the film itself . all these necessary `disclaiming' elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars' series is and this individual film itself . what we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we've come to know and love since the late 1970s . its similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar 
 this film enjoys good production values ( sets 
 this film finds beauty in the normal lady walking down the street . sergi lpez makes for a nice foil . he's a little tubby and hairy 
 this film gives a very three-act feel 
 this film has a good share of drugs - consumed 
 this film has the answer . and 
 this film is a little too intense for viewers 
 this film is a must see . 
 this film is always a pleasure to look at . to boot 
 this film is an enjoyable one 
 this film is his most successful effort yet . perhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks ( gump himself ) 
 this film is pretty amazing 
 this film is yet another great example of the horror genre making a very cool comeback this year with no tight tanktops in sight . and with david caruso acting like the king hotshot like only he can 
" this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film . the killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from "" scream "" ( in fact "
 this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants to be . jonathan demme's direction is bizarre 
 this film simply pales . 
 this film would still be average . luckily 
 this flaw is only a minor inconvenience . director ivan reitman keeps the pace brisk . at a slim 101 minutes 
 this follows that original series nicely down to the big finish . so go on 
 this funny 
" this gives the film a richness it would otherwise be lacking . "" frequency "" has a broad appeal that's rare in movies today . it's a science-fiction movie where the characters come first "
 this guy is in a class of his own . pierre cracks his back while playing golf 
 this hurts the story to the point where antz will quickly get lost in the shuffle of animated films coming out over the next year 
 this interview considers one possibility suggested by ms . watts and implied by several critics in their reviews . our discussion is by no means the only reading 
 this is a beavis and butthead movie . if you do not like beavis and butthead 
 this is a good-natured movie that emphasizes the importance of fidelity . it looks at sex as almost perfunctory by portraying it as unnerving rather than erotic . it's something superficial and yet something necessary to achieve a deeper relationship . at the end 
 this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr . toback for his bantering characters . fortunately 
 this is a rather fun 
 this is a tarantino film 
 this is a very human story . there is a scene toward the beginning where wigand and bergman converse in the cramped interior of wigand's car . it is raining 
 this is a very well made film ( which makes the formulaic additions all the more regrettable ) . the animation is on par with some of disney's best . the story itself is interesting 
 this is about as detailed as the story allows the specific plot to become . the film's hook is the action 
 this is actually a question you need to ask yourself 
 this is actually helpful 
 this is adam sandler right ? ? ? well 
 this is an important work from a great director 
 this is an unfortunate central weakness . but all in all 
 this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet . however 
 this is captured through the movie's subjects instead of heavy-handed photography . because the doctors talk directly to the camera and not to a narrator 
 this is easily excused . it could have been shorter 
 this is exactly the wrong message to send . in a movie dealing with issues of science and faith 
 this is extremely respectable . the most interesting films are the ones that don't explain everything for us 
 this is gonna be a long road 
 this is hardly a film about plot . it's another summer blockbuster with plot points that are beyond unbelievable and dialogue and characters that are mostly completely wooden . case in point : nasa doesn't know that there is even an asteroid on it's way until eighteen days before impact - huh ? another example : at one point in the movie 
" this is hardly an original movie since obvious similarities to 1992's "" a few good men "" exist . there are several things besides the lack of originality which really hurt this film . one is the absence of a good score . in fact "
 this is his slowest film yet . oddly enough for a director with a history of graphic violence presenting a history filled with atrocities by the chinese 
 this is intriguing enough 
 this is just the truest depiction of the old adage 
 this is nbc's version of a science fiction thriller 
" this is not "" wag the dog "" - he wants a real war "
 this is not bad at all . in fact 
" this is not overaccentuated . "" gladiator "" is no "" mortal kombat "" "
" this is not the family i had in mind ! "" "
 this is not the movie to see . the mummy is silly 
 this is obviously the most flexible suit that any batman wears in any of the films 
 this is one movie i wished was longer because it was so damn good while it lasted . it is the equivalent of a roller-coaster in the amount of thrills and fun that it offers . 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; -----------== posted via deja news 
" this is one of "" scream 3 "" ’s finest moments . okay "
 this is one that works beautifully . we don't know what happened . that sense of legal ambiguousness 
 this is only one brief glimpse of complexity and true movie magic in a film that for the most part rehashes the brothers mcmullen . 
 this is perhaps the most effective and engaging 
 this is quickly dispelled . it's almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn't get made much anymore . instead we're stuck with * nsync 
 this is still a good movie 
 this is still a splendidly entertaining movie-movie . it is a bright moon . it was shot entirely in brazil . production values are high . maurice jarre's score is agreeable 
 this is still a warm 
 this is such a rich and textured movie that it doesn't quite matter-their adultery seems like an afterthought 
 this is sure to entertain . 
 this is the best ride out there 
 this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get 
 this is the epitome of your search . a beautiful cast 
 this is the film's crucial failure . it is impossible for cronenbergto create a beautiful world where time 
 this is the group that should sweep it . some humor was a tad uneven from the rest of the film and 
" this is the kind of film that deserves accolades from critics instead of cheap shots . "" afterschool special "" my ass  "" crazy/beautiful "" is the real deal . "
 this is the most violent and graphic film i have ever seen . the articles you read and the warnings you see are justified ; saving private ryan is visually as disturbing as a film can get . the question is 
 this is the movie to see . it should also be noted that as a remake of the chilling original 
 this is the theme 
 this is when he is vulnerable . . . and this time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic 
 this isn't . still 
 this isn't a classical piece of cinema 
 this isn't your regular south park tv show 
 this jocular heavyweight plays out his handful of bitter pill scenes with the unforced menace and self-effacing embarrassment of his imposing bulk . bangs in his eyes 
 this latest attempt does an admirable job at the translation . it 
 this latest effort does a superb job of translating the characters 
 this lends an air of comedy to the whole thing . some viewers may find this juxtaposition uncomfortable 
 this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings . they pass out for approximately seven minutes 
 this live-action comedy still boasts enough energized slapstick and inventive set pieces to best disney's entire 1997 non-animated 
 this makes it all the sweeter as we watch them during their second meeting at the cafe . once more we don't see their amour . after the hotel 
 this makes this film a superior concept 
 this man seemed the most interesting . he's handsome in a boyish sort of way 
 this manages to be a respectable 
" this might have been titled _cliffhanger ii_--it bears the same relationship to that film that most hk film "" sequels "" do to their predecessors . the first half-hour of _daylight_ is setup . subplots are woven "
 this minimalist premise might be described as a modern fable on the perils of wish fulfillment . chareau's restless camera ( once again wielded by superb and ever-attentive cinematographer eric gautier ) is less appropriate here than in his family transit-oriented those who love me can take the train . the scenes that linger are the still ones where rylance and fox separately 
 this movie can't go anywhere . the voiceover narration ( never one of my favorite techniques ) is too verbose and breaks into the story at undesirable moments . ( however 
 this movie has a big story . and big chunks of talky moments . but i will admit the special effects and the acting were above par 
 this movie has had an obvious influence on such films as the terminator ( 8/10 ) 
 this movie is at least 40 minutes too long . one would have wished for a better 'matrix' 
 this movie is just another reason why he will be missed . another great thing about this show ? it's so damn loyal its roots . the original ( four ? ) issues of eastman and laird's dark teenage mutant ninja turtles comic book are replicated pretty faithfully by the movie's plot - now there's something you don't see very often in comic films today . this sure kicks the pants off of a comic-based movie like batman & robin . sure 
 this movie is just awesome . it merely tells its story really well 
 this movie is one that will please many viewers . with plot twists galore and hilarious dark moments 
 this movie is perhaps dated 
 this movie is set in the bizarre georgia town of savannah 
 this movie is supposed to be a wild exaggeration of everything and anything 
 this movie is terrific . all the future will be lost unless the fifth element is found . i don't even know how to explain the movie so i won't . let me say this then . if you like action 
 this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz : i became immersed in the world of a bug's life 
 this movie remains interesting and rare combination of action thriller and gritty 
 this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself . when it comes to recent caper films ( like the grifters and bound ) 
 this movie was made for less than 1 million dollars 
 this movie would have been much different . . . and probably much shorter 
 this narrative is much more complex than that of the brothers mcmullen . unlike his first film 
" this never took place during clinton's term . "" this bit of unreality will jar people out of their suspension of disbelief . also "
 this one also features modernity . there is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization : skyscrapers 
 this one is in no way a parody or homage to this genre of films . . . it's the real deal ! note : this film is packed with strong accents all around 
 this one is more a romantic melodrama . typical is the scene in which gay flings her head back and shakes her hair while bathed in light . she deflects her husband's affections as she fears that he is beginning to fall in love with his client . the dramatic music then comes up high as the camera dwells on mrs . paradine's portrait nearby . in the relatively unsatisfying first half 
 this one is set on a national holiday - the fourth of july . christmas and graduation day are also popular 
 this one might be the first to imply that the titanic hit the iceberg because its lookouts were distracted by a couple making out on deck . however 
 this one stars aidan quinn and donald sutherland 
 this one would be it . the film also boasts some great performances 
 this parody of the scarlet pimpernel story was the first carry on to be produced by rank film productions . two english fops 
 this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than that . black & white is a fascinating film ; it makes a statement about america's youth and hip-hop culture without getting heavy-handed overly serious . featuring a cast of known commodities ( ben stiller 
 this plot allows van peebles' camera to roam the darker side of l . a . - the ghettos 
 this preconception saps the film of some of it's would-be suspenseful moments 
 this probably would have been a much better film . speaking of oliver platt 
 this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers 
 this question becomes very clear from the start . joker joins up with a platoon 
" this quintessential movie musical is getting the royal treatment reserved for classics like "" star wars "" -- a well-deserved "
 this recognition may be something of a shock . nevertheless 
 this remains pretty woman-lite . the pg rating ensures the film is suitable for family viewing 
 this remake often relies on self-parody and comic timing just as much as it does with it's adventurous tone . the movie begins in ancient egypt 
 this reminder leads to anger in his head . however 
 this represents a vry good film made for very little money . often films get special treatment and consideration if they cost less 
" this review likely won't apply much to you . "" scary movie "" started life as two separate screenplays -- "" scream if you know what i did last halloween "" and "" last summer i screamed because friday the 13th fell on halloween "" -- which were merged into one by director keenen ivory wayans . ironically "

 this turned me off to going to the theater for a little bit 
 this unheralded but surprisingly enjoyable comedy from the mtv channel eschews most of the clichs of the adolescent school genre . there's no psycho killer slashing his way through a hunky cast . there's no getting of wisdom through the pursuit of academic excellence . there's no discovering the pain of first love . there's none of the jocks versus the nerds stuff . there's not even the down trodden loser who eventually becomes a hero by bringing glory to his school through unlikely sporting prowess . hell 
 this update heightens the sense of urgency and makes you hop up a time or two . but 
 this usually backfires because the character is never fully developed . this is not the case in a civil action . they have comedy coming from all sides . whether it be duvall's inane questions or macy's sharp anger 
 this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle 
 this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also . . . much of the time wasted could've been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama . even so

 we are reminded not only of the obvious and hilarious rules but also some of the more subtle stereotypes that when thought over are mostly true as well ( the virgin always survives ; have sex and you're dead meat ) . not only are we treated these rules on a plate but also the rules are referenced to a number of different films and actors . the script feels like an obsessive essay from a college film geek who has nothing better to do but find every little blunder from every little film for his own self-satisfaction . in this case 
 we are set-up for a good two hours worth of tom clancy-esque entertainment . add the best big cast this side of the annual woody allen film ( everyone from gabriel byrne to dan butler pop up for cameos ) 
 we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer's house . but thanks to poor editing 
 we are told 
" we are treated to shots of a giant crowd partying like it's new year's eve . i just didn't buy the fact that everyone had completely accepted their fate . no one had the urge to "" rage against the dying of the light "" . despite these small problems "
 we are unable to truly identify with her anymore . but despite its tediousness 
 we begin to see what meadows is trying to show us . his film is not an epic . it is a character study of a small town and how one man in that town tries to deal with its problems . with little plot to concern him 
 we can all agree on one thing -- without a doubt 
 we can easily sympathize and even identify with him . the opening and final images of the film are the same 
 we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all its artistic glory . 
 we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film . but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head . one surprise 
 we can see that kevin's character grows 
 we can understand his reasons . he doesn't buy into the whole notion that just because everyone's going to die 
 we champion her cause and what she represents . however 
 we come to another grocery worker ( katie holmes ) who has a strange fascination with said drug dealer ( the one mentioned earlier ) . really 
 we congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors 
 we connect with it 
 we cut to our heroes 
 we discover 
 we do care about max's fate . teetering on the edge of dementia 
 we don't care . the hero of the sixth sense 
 we don't get a nice 
 we don't get spacey sharon stone 
 we don't have any about the kind of writing he does ; or why he is a figure in the literary establishment ; or what kind of cult surrounds him 
 we don't immediately care for the main character . instead 
 we don't need a robot to locate the west indies . 
 we feel that we all lose to something we can never have . 
 we find that many things aren't exactly as they seem ( that's as much as i could say without ruining anything ) . critique : good little flick that slows down at certain points 
 we get a cameo from vincent shiavelli as a german or austrian assassin who is ordered to do in bond at one point . the government people have small parts 
 we get a rockin' little tune from moby 
 we get a rupert murdoch-esque media mogul/psychotic - elliot carver ( jonathan pryce 
 we get a very definite sense of what he is all about 
" we get doo doo . the films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story "" a long time ago in a galaxy far "
 we get heartfelt sentiment and much humor at the expense of the nadirs of pop culture 
 we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation . based on the novel by john le carr 
" we get it . . . you have to be nasty in order to deal with these nasty people . . . move on ) and this one really major "" coincidence "" which involved a bathtub "
 we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh . she apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over . when john points out the ice on the sherbet 
 we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed . a pall is cast on the whole affair . a master of the understated 
 we get the much more menacing kevin spacey as the lead grasshopper 
 we get the whole picture of andreas and claire's love . we also get glimpses into john and claire's relationship . during a silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward 
 we get to * hear * outtakes as well 
 we get to see a heaven that most of us would probably die to get to . but don't do that 
 we get to see jackie's end-of-movie outtakes . it wouldn't be a jackie chan film without at least one shot of him on the stretcher -- although this time around 
 we get to see the entire gobbling action 
 we get val kilmer voicing moses 
 we get well-timed 
" we had obi-wan telling us mos eisley was a "" wretched hive of scum and villainy . "" in the phantom menace "
" we have 25 minutes of additional footage that's turned a decent underwater thriller into something quite magnificent . i say "" quite "" because some flaws do remain . the most grating is several moments of corny hollywood schmaltz - some new "
" we have george lucas pioneering the idea of "" synthespians "" with a certain floppy-eared pariah . fortunately "
 we have more time to notice the beautiful art 
" we hear a well-timed "" now you're dead ! "" from lead singer peter steele . david carradine makes an appropriately vampiric host ; he fiddles with a blade and cane while introducing the film . after the feature "
" we just try to do the right thing just like dean's jim stark does . not only does "" rebel without a cause "" display these universal emotions for all to relate to but it also shows that america has suffered a uniqe pattern in its social structure . each generation looks at its past generation without a strong connection . this is because times change and in response people change . no matter how popular you were once "
 we know 
 we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting 
 we know he's not going to stop until he has her . but scarlett can't get past her need for ashley 
 we know who commited the murder and how 
 we later discover 
 we learn 
 we learn quickly was 
 we learn that beaumarchais has bought himself a judgeship . into his court comes a member of the nobility demanding an immediate sword fight . beaumarchais 
 we learn that his daughter's life has been a failure . his wife 
 we learn the reason glenn is do dispassionate about the wedding - he's merely marrying julia to prevent a breakup 
 we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth . watching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way . on screen 
 we learn what happens when the money dries up and backers don't return phone calls . in the end 
 we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles . this piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars ( later 
 we like bob ( alec baldwin ) 
 we like him 
 we meet qui-gon jonn ( liam neeson ) and young obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) 
 we meet the crew of six . the veteran captain ( george clooney ) is frustrated because he can't find fish on the grand banks 
 we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble 
 we realize that these buildings aren't too far into the future . this brings the plot even more credibility as genetic engineering becomes more possible by every passing day . the best thing 
 we realize this was simply in judith's mind 
 we really do believe that they are falling in love with each other 
 we really get a sense that for humbert 
 we really start to admire the dude 
 we root for finn although we don't quite understand why she's fueling his fire . robert de niro is nice and sophisticated in the benevolent kind of role he rarely gets to play ; on the other end of the acting spectrum is bancroft 
 we see a black man whose existence has been a punching bag for the white american court system . from the age of eleven to twenty one he was sent to a juvenile prison for a crime he did not commit . then after a successful marriage and boxing career 
 we see a giant earth-moving vehicle used to bury someone . seeing a thing like that in a movie like this is ( to quote roger ebert ) like camille coughing in the first reel and not dying in the last : it * has * to make an encore . i was right . only this time 
 we see charles in action in the opening scene with his last victim . the story takes place in the early 1950s in the small town of petaluma 
 we see flash shots of one snake sinking its fangs into the other . ) one fight is punctuated with a passing train 
" we see george bush on television making his "" this aggression will not stand "" speech . the coens take aim at just about every elite l . a . subculture in the book : the egotistical wealthy businessman ( "" the bums will always lose ! "" shouts the big lebowski at one point ) "
 we see him on a train as she sits on a platform outside 
" we see him putting on his lavender hose . the camera pans up to an all-purple skin-tight bowling outfit with "" jesus "" ( pronounced with a "" j "" "
 we see his loving 
 we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film . as a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots 
 we see only black-and-white programs . but an aghast irene tells her that the agency is a fake 
 we see spencer's view 
 we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers 
 we see that perhaps they both were destined for each other as they share a lingering 
 we see the prison guards divesting her of her luxurious garments and jewels . stripped of her fine raiment 
 we see the sadness of the man's public and private life 
" we see the vehicle slowly sliding across what looks like a snow-covered field . it pauses for a moment before the "" field "" cracks under the bus' weight and the bright yellow vehicle vanishes in an effortless moment "
 we sense a great deal of affection and care . he practically overflows with passion in every scene . fiennes is matched by paltrow ( whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from ) ; she is an actress who exudes strength and conviction in every performance i've seen her in . the two performers work perfectly together 
 we smile along with him . much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation-era icon pam grier in the lead 
 we treat life loosely 
 we understand the motives behind all her actions 
 we watch elwood blues emerge from prison . he stands and waits for his brother jake ( originally played by john belushi ) 
 we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film . this time the disaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean . . . it had to do with bad fish . airplane ! is the story of ted striker ( robert hays ) - an ex-fighter-pilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six 
 we're also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie 
 we're given a hefty dose of physical comedy . we watch the bumbling middle-aged men choreograph pseudo-sexy dance numbers 
 we're given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what's going on . the narrations are more informative than intrusive 
 we're given two points of view in respect to this predicament 
 we're introduced to ray gibson ( eddie murphy ) 
 we're laughing at the outrageousness of craig's puppet show . after that enterprise fails 
 we're laughing at them rather than with them . they spend most of their time paranoid 
 we're left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why . gable and leigh do have great chemistry 
 we're not so much avidly rooting for him to triumph with a moment of epiphany as we're following him through this plot with a sense of mixed dread and morbid fascination -- it's more disturbing journey than quest . still 
 we're not told very much about her character 
 we're only subjected to four of them this time around . mulan boasts the highest death toll of any disney cartoon to date . most of the killing is off-screen and it's all highly depersonalized ( there's nothing to compare with the death of mufasa or bambi's mom ) . there's nothing graphic 
" we're only three months in and the competition ( "" deep rising "
 we're receiving this lesson from a man who has put away a lot of scum in his time 
 we're throwing down . all right 
 we're treated to clich with a thick artsy varnish 
 we're watching an exaggerated version of what we're used to . much of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film - there's a lot of kung fu 
 we've already understood that this is the last straw for a woman plagued with terrible neuroses . rachel griffiths 
 we've been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things 
 we've mostly got the same thing over and over again 
 we've seen the rags-to-riches story gazillions of times 
 wealth 
 wealthy spanish man who finds himself accused of a murder which he is sure he didn't commit ( if you think this sounds like dark city 
 wearing a brilliant suit of sumptuous landscapes 
 wearing a very revealing dress 
 wearing an underwater watch in one scene 
" wearing the same ghostface get-up as in "" scream "" . the voice on the phone wants to know what the noise is . carmen explains she just farted . the killer was referring to the popcorn . soon carmen is racing through the house and across her lawn . she comes to a signpost with arrows reading "" safety "" and "" death "" pointing in opposite directions . you can probably guess the rest . the movie plays out predictably from there "
 weary and tired 60 something 
 weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety 
 weaver 
 weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments . . . weaver being the vulnerable yet strong-within character ( as in aliens ) and hunter being the short 
 wedding-obsessed laura ( cameron diaz ) . the other friends are real estate agent robert boyd ( christian slater )

 well-made 
 well-paced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances . oh yeah 
 well-rounded atmosphere that has been absent in many of 1998's pictures ; the true-love story is one of the best around . certainly recommendable when the traditional slew of indifferent year's-open releases is just around the corner . 
 well-rounded person . certain patterns take shape over the years . for example 
 well-told story . brosnan plays andy osnard 
 well-trained soldiers . guess who wins . having criticized the screenplay

 with lively visuals and a nice cast . it's amazing what special effects can do for a film ; space is a mighty achievement in brain candy . the story tells of the ( space ) family robinson 
 with lonely pubs and busy shopping streets -- it also understands the people who inhabit those spaces 
 with many funny set pieces . for example 
 with matt perreault and my sister jena for free ( matt paid using pre-paid passes ) . if there's ever been an exception to the perils of excessive cliches and non- stop action 
 with matt perreault for free using my sony/loews critic's pass . [theater rating :  : okay seats 
 with mckellan doing most of the talking . that requires fraser to act through body language ; a difficult skill to master 
 with more between his ears than empty space . as maria 
 with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends . the motion cameras film the action 
 with much fanfare and anticipation 
 with much naturalness 
 with multiple plot lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of alan dershowitz . there are flaws ; at times 
 with music-only audio only tracks and commentaries during the film from the cast and crew . when you are in a theatre with great sound and the sound is behind you 
 with my brother john for $8 . 50 . [theater rating : * * * * : excellent seats 
 with nearly all the main characters present . there's sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) 
 with nearly equal time given to the present . the two yankelman boys are broad 
 with new lovers 
 with newly recruited agent jay ( formerly james edwards ) to exterminate the bug and save the planet from intergalactic war . men in black delightfully combines fast-paced action with often hilarious comedy 
 with no commercial interruptions . revenue comes instead from product placement 
 with no control of the course his life will take . nicole projects a quiet intensity as the jittery yet aggressive wife and her performance is stunningly effective : she's headed for an oscar nod . the movie has some help from a similarly strong supporting cast 
 with no last name . this jackie is a world-class chef who co-hosts a popular cooking show on australian television . of course 
 with occasional fresh gems . equally true-to-life is buddy's repertory 
 with one character serving as the comic relief ( that would be johnson ) . the problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief 
 with parallel storylines in new south wales 
 with pathetic attempts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence . he is an adulterous liar and a cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder . however 
 with people too . undeterred by tom's initial reluctance to get involved 
 with plenty of broad comic relief to go around 
 with psychosis setting in on almost every character . the most interesting one is kilgore 
 with pulsing rhythms that capture the viewer . the = performances are simply exquisite 
 with q ( desmond llewelyn 
 with reese's death 
 with rick occasionally delivering his witty one-liner . if they were trying to make a horror-action-comedy 
 with rickman as the director . four of the film's principals 
 with ripley back as a clone 
 with robert duvall playing the role of the vengeance seeking criminal . like its two predecessors 
 with robert rodriguez and his frenetic camera involved 
 with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life . the conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband 
 with scenes of shear suspense and moments of terror and disgust . it opened in 1982 with mixed reviews and now seems to be a minor classic . people will always remember the dogs and the open-up chest and that blood-test scene . they are perfectly set-up and delivered 
 with silent bob doing his best harrison ford 
 with sinister ominous overtones 
 with sitations and scenes which don't exactly work but you can't help but pat allen on the back for trying . but other places are really great scenes . the opening . the sequence with theron 
 with snoots and obstructions covering the corners of the screen . one hidden camera is apparently in his car radio 
 with solid voice work from foley 
 with some beautiful tunes . coupled with the superb visuals 
" with some dark and frightening ideas hidden under its sparkling facade . "" existenz "" has a completely different atmosphere "
 with some intelligent dialogue 
 with some interesting commentary and observations . a movie worth a view 
 with some of the most developed characters that i've seen on the screen all year 
 with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action . this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation 
 with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . thing is 
 with some variation ( and a bit of change 
" with something to amuse both kids and adults . there are funny asides to films such as "" star wars "" and "" jurassic park "
 with stand-out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner 
 with standouts from furlong 
 with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers . the gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car 
 with subtle 
 with superb acting performances to match . granted 
 with sword fights a-plenty and witty one liners . banderas and hopkins have a marvellous chemistry as the two zorro's 
 with terrific acting and some impressive writing from elmore leonard and tarantino . perhaps the best thing about jackie brown is the discovery of pam grier as a major hollywood actress . i can't remember seeing her in anything ( except for a small role in mars attacks ! ) 
 with that money just about to finally dry up 
 with that same real sense of dread 
 with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable . there are so many impressive sequences that i'd find it impossible to list them here 
 with the actors keeping things low-key and restrained 
 with the aim of eventually turning the empire back into a republic . before he can proclaim his decision 
 with the backstory of imhotep's entombment 
 with the bad script he can make real mess . luckily 
 with the caesar's demeanour descending into brutality and ultimately madness . in 182 his sister lucilla and a group of senators tried unsuccessfully to have him assassinated . commodus became obsessed with the gladiatorial games 
 with the camera almost constantly moving . there are tons of great shots in the film 
 with the comedy being on the level of such cult favorites as evil dead 2 . starship troopers just may be on the road to cult status as well . gore is a factor heavily brought up in reviews of this film 
 with the end of the portuguese revolution 
 with the exception of middle 
 with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ) 
 with the exception of the fisher king 
 with the great opening shots or without 
 with the handle shopgirl 
 with the less demanding younger viewers 
 with the magic of cgi 
 with the most successful choice being the casting of real-life mother and daughter phylida law and emma thompson in the most prominent roles . there is a chemistry in their interaction that would be hard to replicate with two different 
 with the notion that what we sow will shall - somewhere 
 with the occasional flash to the past 
 with the only real recognizable one being sctv's own eugene levy as a happy-go-lucky dad . the story revolves around four high school seniors who have one goal before the school year gets out- get laid . that's pretty much it . throughout the movie 
 with the possible exception of leoni ; she delivers a decent performance 
 with the principal players performing with an intensity that recalls the fine ensemble acting in cameron's aliens . the stunts 
 with the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of the titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie . part of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting 
 with the smoke coming off of his slicked head 
 with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble ( usually unsuccessfully ) . the film doesn't feature quite as many one-liners and sight gags as the coens' other comedies ( though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor 
 with the tension growing until the pivotal moment when everything becomes clear . earlier 
 with the trigger-happy and increasingly paranoid lieutenant coffey at odds with the crew about how do deal with the mysterious goings-on around them . the human drama is often riveting 
 with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds 
 with the wags buzzing that mr . tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travolta's then-sagging career . as it turns out 
 with the whole film clocking in at a mere 86 minutes . a bit less action and a little more character development would have been nice 
" with the word "" help "" being spelled with an airplane . beethoven's 5th blasts on the soundtrack . the city seems to stop to take notice of this moment "
 with their cute kids 
 with their glass displays and hermetically sealed imaginations 
 with them you'll have a magical time with a relatively straightforward but well developed story . you'll be rooting for and laughing with spencer and his buddy cy all the way through . star kid runs 1 : 41 . it is rated pg for fantasy combat . although the basically cartoonish broodwarrior might scare the littlest kids 
 with themes of guilt and suffering 
 with then relatively unknown actors 
 with this special dvd version 
 with this unapologetically tough and amoral crime thriller . mel gibson is largely playing against type as the tough 
 with thurman giving a wonderfully cold performance 
 with titanic as the only exception . right away 
 with today's abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner-city life 
 with truman's friends and relatives describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones . the sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else . even if you haven't seen the truman show 
 with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue . however 
 with veronica utilizing her newfound power by constantly rejecting marco's advances . in many ways

 with whom rick had a stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris . the couple needs visas 
 with whom they've experienced a complicated past . but 
 with whose wife he also claims to be sleeping 
 with whose wife he is sleeping 
 with wild at heart's nicholas cage cast in the role of the out of touch rich guy . jack campbell ( cage ) is not a bad man . he's not even a callous man . he's just a regular guy who happens to believe that millions of dollars 
 without a doubt 
 without a lot of explanation 
 without a mawkish triumph-of-the-human-spirit agenda being pushed . but what should have been a celebration of human tenacity comes out as an intelligent film 
 without a shred of doubt in my mind 
 without any intelligent conclusion . the supporting characters are often neglected 
 without ever being boring . it's a remarkable achievement . also remarkable is the animation 
 without ever knowing each others identity . as the movie progresses 
 without hardly any supporting characters 
 without it 
" without it seeming superfluous ? "" american psycho "" is an excellent character piece "
 without knowing it 
 without looking back . although director scott has made missteps in the past 
 without much basis of their being 
 without political ideas thrown in your face . the documentary seeks 
 without prettifying makeup or sexy clothes 
 without scene-stealing episodes 
 without seeming condescending or superior . i admire this film not only because it passes so pleasantly 
 without something like faster 
 without thinking twice about it 
 without those little touches 
 without which

 wonderfully acted 
 wonderfully acted and genuinely entertaining to watch . and yeah 
 wonderfully affable but often inscrutable with his wayward expressions and bemused detachment . this is science fiction told mainly via the power of suggestion ( though it often falls into the sci-fi trap of having entirely too much forced exposition -- we want deeds

" yet after 100 minutes come to feel intimately familiar with . "" twentyfourseven "" is a strong character picture "
 yet all appearances 
 yet barbaric safari bodyguard clayton ( blessed ) . it's easy to tell where the story is going at all times but the screenplay doesn't seem like it was written hastily nor dumbed down for children's enjoyment . sure there's a lot of cliche stuff here 
 yet fundamentally hopeful 
 yet gradually become much different 
 yet he does not display it with enough conviction . his character is very confusing and he is not very believable . this film could have been elevated to a whole new level had daniels been able to give a better performance . the movie is very provocative . it challenges the issues of racism that existed in the past and that still exist today . i really was not expecting all of the elements they brought up 
 yet he still phones regularly to her and their indifferent teenage son . after learning that he is soon to be fired 
 yet her character never becomes completely unlikeable . the huge supporting cast also play a part in making sure this movie is thoroughly entertaining . the dialogue is sharp and well written 
 yet here he fashioned one of the finest italian horror movies of the 1970's . ( note that the film has no connection with the 1975 exorcist-rip off behind the door 
 yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered . it's a wonderful performance in a role custom-tailored for him ; mr . toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr . downey jr . was arrested on drug charges

 yet in some ways he is the most credible 
 yet inevitably robotic . richard gautier may not be robin williams 
 yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstances of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story . in december 1941 
 yet it has no discernible flourish or particular distinctions . he could have approached the film in any number of ways 
 yet it is never showy or pushy . in his 20s 
 yet it remains consistently funny . why is this ? maybe because you know your life is much better than this

 yet nazi-collaborating french vichy government . thousands of refugees from war-torn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america 
 yet nice guy 
 yet not quite connecting until the inevitable conclusion . is it fate that keeps them near each other and ultimately puts them together ? does this predestination carry over to all aspects of life ? as the film starts 
 yet not sappy . one of the more poignant moments is when dorian accompanies sally to lamaze classes . however 
 yet second class director . with the good script he can make very good movie 
 yet she cannot afford to raise her . instead 
 yet she is three-dimensional both in her sadness 
 yet she was overshadowed by teri garr as neary's long-suffering wife ronnie . apart from visual wonders of this film

 yet sometimes violent film 
 yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury

 yet there is something in its tension and the way it feeds you its story that attracts you to it . the film seduces you into thinking that

 you can figure out the rest . it's suspenseful 
 you can guess the rest . booby traps abound as linz sets the usual pratfalls in motion complete with dispensing as much pain as the villains deserve . some scenes are obviously a flagrant misconception of how things work . there's a scene where an fbi field office in another city finds out that the chip may be in chicago and they leave on the first plane out . uh 
 you can guess the story . gizmo winds up in a research lab after his owner 
 you can guess what kind of soundtrack is going to accompany this film . if you don't like rap music

 you can probably figure out the rest . the story * is * simple at heart 
" you can see all 3 surprise endings "" . i have no idea why they would word it that way "
 you can smile at the nifty special effects and remember the good ole days before computer effects made lazy imaginations . would any studio get away with a film like the thing now ? hell no ! not with that ending

 you cannot take your eyes off of owens . the butcher boy truly is a twisted 
 you could find a lot worse than this . 
 you cringe at the sight of his back 
 you decide to stray from the addition of nefarious elements to your system

if chris farley had strapped some fake mutton-chop sideburns to each side of his head 
if spike lee weren't so self-absorbed 
if there has been a better comedy of errors this year than i'd reccomend it be shown with this delightful french import from the director of la cage aux folles . it could be a laugh all day film festival

this is the best british gangster film since the long good friday . jon bennet ( played by andrew howard ) is an extremely good assassin . as such he is probably an evil man but it does not worry him . he has become an unquestioning weapon . he is in the employ of a kingpin ( david calder ) far more evil than he is . but even assassins have innocent pasts . he runs into an old from school days and he is married to a mutual girl friend from school . complicating matters is that they live near where he had a recent job and their young daughter may have seen him at the crime . a big piece of what makes this film work is the depiction of the kingpin . calder is a familiar actor in britain
